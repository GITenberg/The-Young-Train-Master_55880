</div>
<p class='c012'>N<span class='sc'>estling</span> among the hills of the Scioto valley,
in the south-central portion of the state of Ohio,
lies the little town of Wadsworth. Venerable in
its age, proud of its history, the first capital of its
state and the home of men famous in their time,
it lives in the past rather than in the present, and
life there moves in a quiet and dignified manner,
conducive to peace but not to progress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Its streets, shaded by the elms planted by the
pioneers, show traces of those early days; one of
the old inns, with its swinging sign still stands;
no roar of traffic disturbs its Sabbath stillness.
Just to the east of it rises Mount Logan, named
for the Indian chieftain known to every train-service,
and there is a legend that, standing on the
summit of that hill, the day before his death, he
cast a spell over the surrounding country, in order
that the peace of his grave might never be disturbed.
However that may be, certain it is that
a dreamy influence pervades the atmosphere and
gives to the town an air of leisure and calm deliberateness
which nothing can dispel.</p>

<p class='c013'>It had been founded more than a century before,
when the country for a hundred miles around was
an unbroken forest, by a little band of pioneers
who, acquiring title to unnumbered acres by virtue
of their service in the Revolution, pushed their
way over the mountains from Virginia. Some of
them brought their slaves with them, only to free
them when they reached their new home. Other
families from Virginia joined the little settlement
and lent their hands to the battle with the wilderness.
That southern flavour had never been lost,
nor the southern deliberateness and dislike of innovation,
nor the southern preference for agriculture
rather than for manufacture.</p>

<p class='c013'>By mere chance of geographical position, Wadsworth
lies half way between Parkersburg, a hundred
miles away to the east, and Cincinnati, a hundred
miles away to the south-west; so, when the
great P. &amp; O. railway, looking for new fields to
conquer, purchased the local line which connected
those two cities, and which was fast degenerating
into a “streak of rust,” it saw that Wadsworth
must be the centre of the new division, since it was
the most economical place from which to handle
the business of the division and at which to maintain
the division shops. All this, however, it carefully
concealed from public view, but, expressing
a supreme indifference as to whether the shops
were placed at Wadsworth or somewhere else,
offered to bring them there for a bonus of a hundred
thousand dollars. After long delay and hesitation,
the town was bonded for that amount, and
the shops were formally established at the spot
where they must, of necessity, have been placed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here also were the division offices, from which
the business of the division was handled. They
were upon the second floor of the dingy depot
building which has been described more particularly
in “The Young Train Dispatcher,” and need not
be dwelt upon here, except to observe that the
passing years had added to its dinginess and disreputable
appearance.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>From these offices there descended, one bright
October evening, lunch-basket in hand, a young
man, who, springing lightly across the branching
tracks of the yards, reached the street beyond and
turned eastward along it. It was noticeable that
he seemed to know everyone employed around the
yards and that they seemed to know him, and
greeted him with a cordiality evidently genuine.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ten minutes’ walk brought him to a trim cottage
standing back from the street, amid a bower
of vines. Its grounds were ample, and well-kept.
At one side was a little orchard, whose trees showed
the glint of ripening fruit. Farther back, near the
barn, a cow was grazing, and the busy clatter of
chickens came from an enclosure to the right. The
place somehow gave the impression that those who
lived within were happy and contented people; not
rich, but able, by the labour of their hands, to assure
themselves a comfortable livelihood—which
is, perhaps, the happiest condition vouchsafed to
human beings.</p>

<p class='c013'>Through the gate of this house the young man
turned, and went slowly up the walk leading to the
door. But as he stretched out his hand to turn the
knob, the door flew open and a girl of about sixteen
fairly flung herself into his arms.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, Mamie!” he cried. “<i>Is</i> it Mamie?”
and he held her off for a moment’s inspection.
“When did you get back?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On Number Three,” she answered. “I had a
notion to wait for you, and then I thought it would
be nicer to come home and surprise you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The words “Number Three” stamped both
speakers as of the railroad. For who but one
raised in the atmosphere of the road would
know that “Number Three” was the west-bound
flier?</p>

<p class='c013'>“See how brown I am,” she added, holding her
face up for his inspection.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” he agreed, looking down at her, “you
are. Did you have a good time?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Only so-so,” she answered, smiling up at him.
“I can have the best time of all right here at
home.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So can I,” he agreed. “It’s been a little lonesome
with you away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Has it, Allan?” she asked, quickly, her eyes
shining with the glint of sudden tears. “It’s nice
of you to say that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s true: and it won’t hurt to say it,
now you’re back. But I didn’t dare tell you when
I wrote. I wanted you to enjoy your visit. I
thought you were going to stay till Tuesday.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I couldn’t stay any longer than to-day!”
she protested, quickly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why not?” he asked, looking at her in surprise.
“What’s going to happen to-day?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come in and you’ll see,” she answered, and led
him triumphantly into the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Through the hall they went, into the dining-room
beyond, where a bright-faced woman, just
entering middle-age, was putting the finishing
touches to a table immaculately spread.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, there ye are!” she cried, turning as they
entered. “What kept you so long, Allan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve been out here gossiping with Mamie,” he
explained, laughing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was afeerd the supper would git stale,” she
said. “I don’t like to keep things warmed up;
they ain’t got the same taste they have when they’re
cooked jest right and served right away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You needn’t wait for me, if there’s company,”
he said, seeing that an extra place had been
laid.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I reckon the company’s willin’ to wait,”
she retorted, with a laugh. “Only don’t be no
longer than ye kin help.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I won’t,” Allan promised and hurried away.</p>

<p class='c013'>Five minutes later, he opened the door of the
dining-room again, and saw who the visitor was.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, Reddy!” he cried, going quickly forward,
his hand outstretched. “How are you?
I’m glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The same here, Allan,” answered Reddy Magraw,
warmly gripping the hand outstretched to
him in his own honest palm. “An’ mighty glad
I was when Jack asked me t’ be here t’-day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To-day,” echoed Allan, glancing quickly
around at the smiling faces. “Why, what day
is it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you know?” asked Jack, his face all one
broad grin. “Don’t you know, boy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mamie’s eyes were dancing, as she looked at
Allan’s perplexed countenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, it’s a disgrace, Allan, if you don’t remember!”
she cried.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll tell you what day it is, me boy,” said
Reddy, his face beaming. “It’s jist eight year ago
t’-day sence a little scalpeen named Allan West
come along out there on Section Twinty-one an’
asked the foreman, Jack Welsh, fer a job. We’re
meetin’ here t’-night t’ celebrate his good jedgment
in givin’ ye one.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Tis the thing in all my life I’m most proud
of,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ the thing that has made me happiest,”
added Mary.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I’d never have forgiven him, if he hadn’t,”
cried Mamie, at which they all laughed, a little
uncertainly, and sat down, their hearts very tender.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can it really be eight years?” asked Allan,
after a moment’s silence. “It doesn’t seem possible.
And yet when one thinks what has happened—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They has a lot happened,” agreed Reddy.
“An’ many a happy day we had out there on Section
Twinty-one. Not that I don’t like the work
now, Jack,” he added. “But my gang don’t seem
t’ be loike the old one. Mebbe it’s because I’m
gittin’ old an’ don’t see things with quite so much
gilt on ’em as I used to.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Old! Nonsense!” cried Jack. “Why, you’re
a young man, yet, Reddy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I ain’t,” said Reddy. “I ain’t young by
no means. An’ I’ve allers thought that that belt
I got on the head from that runaway ingine had
took some of the ginger out o’ me. But that’s all
fancy, most likely,” he added, hastily, seeing Allan’s
eyes upon him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look here, Reddy,” said Allan, “do you think
my hitting you that time had anything to do with
it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I don’t,” said Reddy. “I think that was
the only thing that saved me. I’ve told ye already
that I wouldn’t have complained if ye’d kilt me.
Tell me about it ag’in, boy; I can’t hear that story
too often.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Allan told again the story of that wild Christmas
eve when, as track-walker, he had found a
gang of wreckers tearing up the rails, and how the
pay-car had been saved, and the lives of those in
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, it must have been terrible!” cried Mamie,
who had been listening with starting eyes, as
though she had never before heard the story.
“Think of creeping up alone on that gang of men!
Weren’t you awfully frightened, Allan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” answered Allan, smiling at her earnestness.
“I didn’t have time to get frightened, somehow.
But,” he added, laughing, “I don’t mind
confessing, now, that two or three days later, as
I lay in bed thinking the whole thing over, I was
scared nearly to death. It’s a fact,” he went on,
seeing their puzzled countenances. “I just turned
kind of faint thinking about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ no wonder,” said Reddy. “’Twas enough
t’ make anybody turn faint. I remember jest sich
another case. You knowed Tom Spurling, Jack?”
he added, turning to Welsh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” nodded Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, then you’ll remember what a hot-headed
feller he was—he had a head o’ red hair, by the
way, purty nigh as red as mine. Well, one evenin’
he was hurryin’ acrost the yards t’ git his train—he
was conductor on the west-bound accommodation.
He was carryin’ his cap an’ his dinner-bucket
an’ his lantern an’ his little red tin dickey-box,
an’ he was hittin’ it up lively, bein’ a minute
or two late. It was a kind o’ foggy night, an’ jest
as he got to the platform, Bill Johnson’s yard
ingine come up behind an’ poked him in the legs
with its footboard. Well, everybody expected t’
see Tom ground up in about two winks, but some
way the ingine throwed him up on the platform,
where he fell sprawlin’. Bill stopped the ingine
an’ got down t’ see if Tom was hurted. Tom was
settin’ up rubbin’ his head an’ glarin’ down at the
lunch his missus had fixed up fer him an’ which
was now scattered all over the platform and purty
well mixed with cinders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Are ye hurted, Tom?’ asked Bill.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Hurted!’ roared Tom. ‘No, o’ course not, ye
blame fool! But look at them victuals!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Jumpin’ Jehosaphat!’ says Bill. ‘Ye ain’t
worryin’ about them are ye?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Yes, I am!’ yells Tom, jumpin’ to his feet.
‘Why don’t ye look where ye’re goin’ with thet
ole mud turtle o’ yourn? Fer jest about half a
cent—’</p>

<p class='c013'>“But some o’ the fellers got ’em apart, an’ Tom
climbed on his train a minute later, still cussin’ Bill
fer the loss o’ his lunch.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, sir, he run his train down t’ Cinci all
right, an’ next mornin’ started back with her, an’
they’d got as fer back as Midland City, when one
o’ the passengers come an’ told the brakeman that
the conductor was sick. An’ mighty sick he was,
layin’ in a seat, white as a sheet, lookin’ like his
last hour had come.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Fer Heaven’s sake, Tom,’ says the brakeman,
‘what’s the matter?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Oh, I was nearly kilt!’ groans Tom, hoarse
as a frog.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Kilt!’ says the brakeman. ‘Where? Shall
I holler fer a doctor? Mebbe they’s one on board.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘No,’ says Tom. ‘I ain’t hurted.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The brakeman thought he’d gone crazy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘What you talkin’ about, anyhow?’ he says.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘No,’ goes on Tom, ‘but it’s God’s providence
I wasn’t chewed into mincemeat.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘When?’ says the brakeman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Last night,’ says Tom, ‘by thet yard ingine
at Wadsworth. It’s jest come to me what a narrer
escape I had.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, the brakeman told me, Tom was about
the sickest man he ever seen fer an hour or more,
an’ then he peckered up a little, an’ finally was all
right ag’in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can imagine just how he felt,” said Allan,
amid the laughter caused by Reddy’s story. “I
fancy it’s a good deal like seasickness. It just
swoops down on you and takes the nerve out of you
and leaves you limp as a rag.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From one story, they passed to another—the
wreck at Vinton, the fight at Coalville, Dan Nolan’s
death—stories which have already been told in
the earlier books of this series, and which need
not be repeated here.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did ye ever hear anything more o’ that snake,
Nevins, what I chased all over creation that night
he tried t’ wreck the president’s special?” inquired
Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Allan answered, “I heard about him
just the other day. Mr. Schofield told me that he
had seen him at Cincinnati—passed him on the
street.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s he doin’?” asked Jack, quickly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know. Earning an honest living, I
hope. Mr. Schofield said he was well-dressed and
seemed to be prosperous.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, mebbe he <i>is</i> earnin’ an honest livin’,
but I doubt it,” said Jack. “I don’t think he
knows how. That reminds me. I heard this arternoon
that Hayes is goin’ to Springfield.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Allan. “He’s to be train master
on the Illinois division.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then that means that they’ll be a chief dispatcher
to appoint here. Who’ll get it? Goodwood?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; he’s next in line.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ that’ll make you senior dispatcher?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When I think,” said Jack, “that eight year
ago, this here felly was a kid lookin’ fer a job
an’ that now he’s senior dispatcher, with a mighty
good chance o’ bein’ superintindent some day, I
begin t’ believe that a felly has a fair chance in
this country, arter all. You know they’s allers
sayin’ we’re all ground down by wealth; but I’ve
noticed that the fellies who’s ground down are
them that spends most o’ their time in some bar-room
hollerin’ about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s true,” Allan agreed. “And don’t forget
that you’ve gone up from section foreman to
division roadmaster in the same time, and that
you’re not done yet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I am, me boy,” said Jack, gravely. “I
haven’t got th’ eddication t’ go any furder. I’ve
got the experience, but that’s only half the equipment
a felly has to have to reach the top. I don’t
know jest how it is, but eddication—the real thing—seems
 t’ kind o’ give a man a bigger grasp of
things. He kin put two and two together quicker—he
kin see furder.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack’s right,” said Reddy. “Now I’ve reached
my limit in section foreman. It’s as fur as I kin
go. I ain’t complainin’. I’m contented. But some
of us is built fer speed, an’ some of us is built fer
strength. Some of us has to pull freight, and some
gits to pull polished Pullmans, but I reckon it all
comes to th’ same thing in the end.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Allan, quietly, “passenger and
freight all have the same destination. And you
know, as well as I do, that it’s the freight that
counts most when it comes to figuring results.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The ringing of the telephone bell interrupted
them, and Mamie ran to answer it. She was back
in a moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Somebody wants you, Allan,” she said. “Mr.
Schofield, I think.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Anxious eyes followed him, as he arose and
went to the ’phone. A call from the superintendent
might mean so many things—usually did mean
disaster of some kind. He was gone a long time,
and as the minutes lengthened, the shadow on the
faces of those about the table deepened. They tried
at first to keep up a semblance of conversation, but
that finally dropped away and they sat silent. That
it was something serious was evident.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Allan came back at last, and as he caught
sight of their anxious faces, he laughed outright.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, it’s not a wreck,” he said, “and I’m not
fired.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He sat down, and the others waited. If it was
anything he could tell them, they knew he would.
If it was official business, they did not wish to
question him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The fact is,” he went on, slowly, 
Mamie’s face with evident amusement, “a very unusual
thing has happened.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Allan!” Mamie burst out, “if you’re going
to tell us, please hurry and do it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A very unusual thing,” Allan proceeded with
provoking deliberation. “You know I told you
that Mr. Hayes is going to Springfield.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Mamie, encouragingly, bouncing in
her seat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ain’t he goin’?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes; he’s going. He went this afternoon.
But the fact is, Goodwood don’t want his job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He says the hours are too long, and the added
responsibility more than the added salary. He says
he’s contented where he is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ho!” said Reddy. “Reached his limit jest
like me, an’ knows it. Well, it’s a wise man that
knows when to let well enough alone.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Mamie’s face suddenly gleamed with understanding,
and she jumped from her seat and rushed
around the table to Allan’s side.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know!” she cried. “I know! Oh, you
stupid people! Don’t you see? Allan’s to be chief dispatcher!”</p>

<p class='c013'>They were all on their feet now.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What, Allan! Is it?” cried Jack, incoherently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” answered Allan, “I guess it is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack came over to him and put his hands on his
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eight year ago to-day,” he said, looking him
in the eyes. “I’m proud of ye, me boy. But I
don’t need t’ tell ye that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And he’ll make the best chief this division ever
had,” added Reddy with conviction. “Where’s
my hat?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you ain’t goin’!” protested Mrs. Welsh.
“It’s early yet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it is,” said Reddy. “But I can’t stay.
Not with this news in my craw. I must tell the old
woman and the boys. They ain’t a man on the
division that won’t be glad.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c006'>CHAPTER II <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>NEW DUTIES</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>T<span class='sc'>wo</span> days later, Allan West entered regularly
upon his new duties as chief dispatcher of the Ohio
Division of the P. &amp; O. railway. Meantime, news
of his promotion had got about, and it seemed as
though every employee of the division, high or low,
had made it a point to seek him out and congratulate
him. For Allan, in the eight years he had
been with the road, had endeared himself to everyone
by kindness and considerateness, and even those
engineers and conductors who had a standing grievance
against all dispatchers had come to confess
that he was the squarest one they had ever met.</p>

<p class='c013'>The chief dispatcher’s office is a large and pleasant
room, looking down over the busy yards, and
is shared by Mr. Plumfield, the train master. A
great desk stands between the front windows, one
side of which belongs to the train master and the
other to the chief dispatcher. On it two sounders
clicked, and from the open door of the dispatchers’
office, at Allan’s back, came the incessant clamouring
of other instruments.</p>

<p class='c013'>To one unaccustomed to it, this ceaseless noise
would have been perfectly distracting, but to the
habitués of the offices it was scarcely noticeable.
And yet, though they seemingly paid no heed to
it, it had a meaning for them, and anything out of
routine attracted their attention instantly. For
telegraphers develop a sixth sense, which takes
up and translates what the instruments are saying
without interfering with any of the others.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps you have seen an engineer sitting beside
his engine, reading a paper while the complicated
mechanism whirls smoothly along at its
appointed task. Suddenly, without cause so far
as you can see, he starts up, snatches up an oil can
or a wrench, and squirts a jet of oil upon a bearing
or tightens a nut somewhere. No sign of
trouble has been audible to you, but his trained
ear, even though his brain was otherwise engaged,
had caught an unaccustomed burr or rattle and had
called his attention to it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such instances might be multiplied indefinitely.
Everyone who works at a certain task, or goes
through a certain set of motions, becomes, after
a time, to some extent automatic. Physiologists
call such motions “reflex,” and tell us that in time
the brain passes on such volitions to the spinal cord
and so frees itself for other work—one of the
wise provisions of our bodily mechanism, whose
wonder and perfection very few of us understand
or appreciate.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan was, of course, acquainted, in a general
way, with the duties of his new position, and he
lost no time in further familiarizing himself with
them. All of the operators along the line were
under his control. He assigned them to their duties,
promoted them or discharged them as occasion
might arise, investigated any delinquency on their
part, and held them accountable for the proper performance
of their duties. In addition to this, he
was required to see that empty freight cars were
furnished the various agents along the line, as they
needed them, and that loaded cars were taken up
promptly and sent forward to their destinations.
Every day, each agent wired in his car requirements,
and it was the chief dispatcher’s business to
see that these requirements were filled as speedily
as possible. He was also expected to see that the
dispatchers understood their duties, and to unravel
any knotty point which any of them might not
understand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Further than that, the clerical duties of the position
were very heavy. He must make daily reports
of the amount of freight handled; and if any
freight crew was kept on the road more than sixteen
hours, a special report must be prepared for
the Interstate Commerce Commission, giving the
facts in the case, and explaining why the crew had
been kept out so long; for it is unlawful to keep
any crew on duty for more than that length of
time. A wise provision, for before this law was
enacted, in busy seasons, railroads sometimes kept
their crews on duty for twenty-four, thirty-six and
even forty-eight hours at a stretch—an abuse
which inevitably resulted in accidents from the men
going to sleep while on duty, or being so exhausted
by the long hours as to grow careless and forgetful
of orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>These were the duties when everything was moving
in regular order. At other times, the supreme
duty of every one connected with the office was to
get them back to regular order. For a great railroad
system is like a complicated machine—no
part can run smoothly unless all are running
smoothly, and the throwing of the smallest cog
out of gear cripples the entire mechanism. Although
the train master was the “trouble man,”—in
other words, the man whose especial duty it
was to superintend the clearing away of wrecks,
and the straightening out of traffic—whenever
anything happened to interfere with it, all other
work became subordinate to that of restoring traffic
to its normal condition.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>On this morning, however, everything was moving
in regular order; the sounders clicked out the
reports of trains on time; there were no calls for
cars which could not be answered promptly and no
freight along the line which the regular locals could
not handle. Conductors came and registered, compared
their watches with the big electric clock which
kept official time for the division, and departed;
others reported in; trainmen loitered before the
bulletin board, or gossiped in their lounging-room
across the hall; the typewriting machine of the
train master’s stenographer clicked steadily away;
and there was about the place a contented hum of
industry, such as one hears about a bee-hive on a
warm day in late spring when the apples are in
bloom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I heard some bad news about Heywood, while
I was in Cincinnati yesterday,” remarked Mr.
Plumfield casually, in the course of the morning,
referring to the general superintendent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bad news?” questioned Allan, looking up
quickly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t believe he’s making good. Nothing
definite, you know; just a general feeling of dissatisfaction
with him. I shouldn’t be surprised if
he lost out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the matter with him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You knew his wife died?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She was a mighty sweet woman, and I imagine
had lots of influence on Heywood. Well, after her
death, he seemed to go to pieces more or less. His
daughter, Betty, was away at school, or somewhere,
and didn’t know until she came home. You
knew her?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes; very well. I used to see her when
they lived here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; I rather fancied, sometimes—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thought a great deal of her and still do,”
Allan interrupted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Plumfield nodded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, she came home and tried to brace him
up, and I dare say succeeded pretty well for a
while—”</p>

<p class='c013'>He stopped. There was no need that he should
say anything more.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan, staring at the report before him, remembered
how kind Mr. Heywood had been to him
years before; remembered his first vision of Betty
Heywood, as she came bursting into her father’s
office, one day when he was there. He had not
seen her for nearly four years—not since the
night when she had ridden away on the east-bound
flyer to go to school in the East. Had she changed,
he wondered, or was she still the same warm-hearted,
impulsive girl whom he had known?</p>

<p class='c013'>The sounder on Allan’s desk began to call him,
and he came back to the present with a start. He
opened the key and replied with the quick .., ..,
which told that he was ready to receive the message.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>“Chief dispatcher, Ohio Division,” clicked out
the little instrument. “A special train consisting
of combination coach and private car will leave
Cincinnati east-bound about ten o’clock to-morrow
morning. You will have your best engines ready
to take it through to Wadsworth, and from there
to Parkersburg. This special is to run without
orders, its time to be governed only by the maximum
speed of the engine, and is to be given a clear
track with rights over everything. It must be expedited
in every way possible.”</p>
<div class='c015'><span class='sc'>A. G. Round</span>,</div>
<div class='c015'>“<i>General Manager</i>”</div>
<p class='c012'>Mr. Plumfield whistled softly, as the message
ended.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who do you suppose it is?” he asked. “The
Emperor of Germany?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s certainly an unusual order,” agreed
Allan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I never saw but one like it before,” added Mr.
Plumfield. “That was when the president of the
road was somewhere in the west, and his wife was
reported dying back at Baltimore. We gave him
right of way then.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did he get there in time?” asked Allan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, she didn’t die. Maybe it was his presence
saved her. Anyway, his train covered the two
hundred miles from Cincinnati to Parkersburg at
an average speed of fifty-three miles an hour.
That was going some.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll see if we can beat it to-morrow,” Allan
answered, and turned to the task of clearing the
track for the special.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he knew only the approximate time that the
special would leave Cincinnati, it was necessary to
prepare several plans, the one to be adopted depending
upon the exact time the train pulled out from
the Grand Central depot. From Cincinnati to
Loveland he had a double track to work with, but
from Loveland east, only a single track, and it was
necessary to so arrange the schedule that no train
would interfere with the special and at the same
time to provide that they be interfered with as little
as possible. Another difficulty arose from the
fact that it was impossible to tell exactly how fast
the special would run, and Allan’s brow wrinkled
perplexedly as he bent above the time-card.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I tell you what I’m going to do,” he said, at
last, “I’m going over the road with this train myself.
I’m not going to take any chances.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And that night, with the time-card in his pocket
and his plans carefully laid, Allan boarded the accommodation
for Cincinnati.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>The man in whose behalf this extraordinary order
had been issued was no less a personage than
a candidate for the Presidency of the United States.
His election had been thought fairly certain, but
hinged upon New York State. This, he had been
confidently assured by the party leaders, he would
carry without difficulty; and he had not visited it
except early in the campaign, for a few speeches.
He had then devoted his attention to some doubtful
states in the middle west, when, with the election
only ten days off, he had received a message
urging him to reach New York at the earliest possible
moment, that unexpected opposition had developed
there, and that every moment was precious.
In this strait, he had appealed to the railroads, and
they had leaped to his aid.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not because of the man, nor because of the fact
that he was a candidate for the greatest office
within the gift of the people of this republic; but
because they regarded his election as vital to their
welfare. For the railroads had fallen among
troublous times. The business regeneration of the
past few years had affected them deeply. Whether
rightly or wrongly, the American public, or a large
portion of it, had come to believe that railroad
management was corrupt and wasteful, that it discriminated
against its patrons and used its wealth
and influence to secure the passage of laws inimicable
to public welfare. So severe measures had
been taken to curtail this power, and to protect the
interests of both the stockholders of the roads and
of the people who gave them business. The issuing
of passes had been forbidden; a commission
had been established by the government to prevent
and punish any discrimination in favour of any
shipper of freight; laws had been passed curtailing
the hours of railway employees; in many states
the legal fare to be charged passengers had been
reduced by act of legislature from three to two
cents a mile, and there had sprung up a wide-spread
demand that freight rates be also regulated by law.
Many roads felt that ruin was staring them in the
face, and an all-important question with them was
the election of a president who would regard them
with friendly eyes and who would throw his influence
against any revolutionary measures which
might be aimed at them.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not wonderful, then, that they should
have rushed to the assistance of this man, since his
opponent was pledged to work for the very measures
which the roads dreaded; and that, when his
election seemed in danger, they should have placed
their resources absolutely at his disposal, and have
given him right of way over everything. He had
been hurried across the plains of Missouri, shot into
Saint Louis, flung across the prairies of Illinois and
Indiana, and now, at 9.45 o’clock in the morning,
the train shot into the Grand Union station at Cincinnati,
and came to a stop with a jerk.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ten minutes before, Allan, able at last to time
the exact minute of its arrival, had sent out the
messages which would govern its movements from
Cincinnati to Wadsworth. There were to be no
stops, except one for water, and, if all went well,
He was determined to cover the hundred miles in
a hundred minutes. He knew his engine and knew
the engineer—957, with Tom Michaels, lean, gray-haired,
a bundle of nerves, a man to take chances
if necessary, yet never to take one that was unnecessary;
and he believed that the distance could
be covered in that time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Three minutes were allowed in which to change
engines, and half a dozen men were waiting to
make the change. The air-hose was uncoupled and
the old engine backed away. While the 957 was
run down and coupled up, four men with flaring
torches had been making an examination of the
coach and private car, and in just three minutes,
or at 9.48 <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>, the conductor held up his hand
and Michaels gently opened the throttle.</p>

<p class='c013'>The old engineer’s face was gleaming. It was
the first time in his long life at the throttle that
he had ever been given a free track and told to go
ahead. But he nursed her carefully over the network
of tracks in the yards, out through the ditch
and past the stock-yards before he really let her out.
Then, slowly and slowly, he drew the throttle open,
and with every instant the great engine gathered
speed, while the fireman, equally interested and
enthusiastic, nursed the fire until the fire-box was
a pit of white-hot, swirling flame.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan had ensconced himself on the forward end
of the fireman’s seat, and sat for a time, watch in
hand. Then he looked over at Michaels and
nodded. They were making their mile a minute.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s like ridin’ on a shootin’ star,” the fireman
shouted up, as he rested for a moment from his
exertions, bracing himself, his feet wide apart,
against the swaying of the engine. “Right
through the middle of a white-hot comet,” he
added, scraping the sweat from his forehead. “It
surely is a hot day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he bent again to his task. Every thirty-five
seconds he threw three scoops-full of coal into
the fire-box, then closed the door for the same
length of time. And always he kept his eye on
the indicator, to see that the pressure never fell
below the “popping-off” point. It may be that,
for this occasion, Michaels had hung a little extra
weight on the lever of his safety-valve. At any
rate, no steam was wasted through it.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a block system as far as Loveland,
but beyond that, they had to trust to the observance
of orders issued from division headquarters. On
and on sped the train, the speed creeping up to
sixty-five miles an hour, and once to seventy-four
on a long down-grade. The whistle seemed to
shriek its warning almost continuously; stations
seemed to crumble to pieces with a crash as the
train leaped past them; farm houses fluttered by
or wheeled in stately procession across the landscape.
And always Michaels sat, his hand on the
throttle, his eyes on the track ahead, swaying to
the motion of the engine, as a rider sways to his
steed; only moving from time to time to glance
at his watch or at the steam and water gauge, to
blow the whistle and open the injector which shot
the water from the tank to the boiler of the engine.
The track ahead seemed to be rushing toward them
only to be swallowed up; the nearer landscape was
merely a gray blur; the telegraph poles flashed by
“like the teeth of a fine-tooth comb,” as the fireman
remarked; and always there was the roar of
the great machine, the crash and rumble as the
engine hurled itself along the rails. It was a marvel
that it kept them, or seemed so—a marvel that it
did not hurtle away cross-country at its own sweet
will.</p>

<p class='c013'>At New Vienna they paused for water. Michaels,
with the skill of a magician, brought his
engine to a stop with the tank-opening exactly
underneath the penstock beside the track. The fireman
lowered it with a clang and the water rushed
and foamed down into the almost empty tank.
Then, as the penstock swung up into place, Michaels
opened the throttle and they were off again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan, glancing across at the engineer, saw how
the sweat was pouring down his face; how his face
had aged and lined under the strain; how the lips
had tightened. It was a hot day, unusually hot for
so late in the year, and the atmosphere was close
with threatened storm—but it was not the heat
alone which brought out the sweat upon the engineer,
nor the discomfort which lined and aged his
face. Yet he sat erect as ever, his eyes glancing
from the track ahead to the gauges, and back again.
Once he stooped from his seat to shout a warning
word to the fireman, when the needle for an instant
dropped a notch. Allan, glancing back, saw that
the rear car was lost in a whirl of dust. It seemed
as insignificant as a tail—a mere appendage to be
whipped hither and thither as the engine willed.
He had ridden in cabs before—many times—but
never under such conditions as these. He knew
the track—he knew the rattle of every target as
they flashed past it, the roar of every bridge as they
rushed through it; and suddenly he remembered
the sharp curve just beyond Greenfield, and wondered
if Michaels would slow up for it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The huddle of roofs that marked the town
flashed into sight ahead, grew and grew, was upon
them. The rattle of switches told that they were
in the yards, but yard-limit speed had no bearing
upon this case. He caught a glimpse of the signal
before the station, and saw with relief that it was
set at safety. Everything was working well, then,
as he had planned it. Twenty miles more and they
would be at Wadsworth, with the first leg of the
journey covered. There was no need that he should
go further with the train—he had tested its capabilities—he
would know how to provide for it.
Then the curve was upon them, and he braced himself
for the jar he knew must come as the engine
struck it. Michaels, his face drawn and tense, sat
staring ahead, but made no move toward closing
the throttle, even a hair’s-breadth.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a mighty jolt, and the engine seemed
to climb over the rails. Allan could feel it lift
perceptibly, but the wheels held. A moment
more—</p>

<p class='c013'>And then, as they cleared the curve and caught
a glimpse of the straight track beyond, he saw
steaming toward them, under full headway, not a
hundred yards away, another engine. Only for an
instant he saw it; then, as Michaels closed the
throttle and jerked on the brakes, he closed his eyes
involuntarily, for he knew that no power on earth
could stop the train in time.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c006'>CHAPTER III <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>THE MIRACLE AT GREENFIELD</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>M<span class='sc'>eanwhile</span>, back in his private car, the great
man, as was his custom in any circumstance, had
made himself as comfortable as might be. It was
a luxurious car, eighty feet in length, with bath,
kitchen, lounging-room, bedrooms, dining-room—in
fact, everything that a modern home could have,
on a small and compact scale. Travel in this car
was as luxurious as travel could be. And even at
the wild rate of speed at which it was jerked forward,
it maintained a long, steady roll, much like
that of a ship on a calm sea. Only when one
glanced out the windows at the blurred landscape
was the speed apparent, unless, indeed, one kept
one’s eyes on the needle, which flickered ceaselessly
up and down on the speed-indicator.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of these things the great man studiously
refrained from doing, but turning his back alike
to the windows and to the indicator, he devoted
his time to going through his correspondence, dictating
to his secretary, and meditating ways and
means for holding New York in the column of the
“safe and sane.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He sat up late into the night, as the train whirled
across the Illinois prairies, smoking meditatively,
a wrinkle of perplexed anxiety between his brows,
for the path to the White House was proving more
thorny than he had thought possible. Not the
least of his unexpected tribulations was this record-breaking
trip half across the continent. He was
naturally a nervous man, and this hurtling through
space distressed him acutely. He felt that he was
being offered as a sacrifice upon the altar of his
country, and the sensation was anything but pleasant.
His only consolation was that his meteoric
trip was being featured by the papers, both friendly
and unfriendly, and would prove an excellent advertisement—more
especially since the friendly
papers were taking care to point out how lightly
the great man considered his own comfort—nay,
even his life—when his country called him! He
smiled grimly to himself as he thought of those
headlines, for he was thoroughly conscious that he
was not in the least heroic, but merely an ordinary
man with a faculty of making friends, a power
of keeping his mouth shut when it was wise to
do so, and a gift for rounded periods when rounded
periods were demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>He went to bed, at last, long after midnight,
and it was not until Cincinnati had been left far
behind that he arose. He took his bath, dressed
himself leisurely, and finally sat down to breakfast.
Sitting thus, with his side to the window, he could
not escape the vision of the landscape, which was
rushing madly past. Involuntarily his eyes rested
for an instant on the speed-indicator, and he started
as he saw that the needle showed an hourly speed
of seventy-two miles. He closed his lips firmly
together and with a hand not altogether steady
started to attack his grapefruit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then suddenly the car lurched heavily and the
next instant it seemed to stand on end and buckle
in the middle. The great man was thrown forward
across the table, which overturned with a
crash; a negro waiter, who was just entering with
a tray of dishes, was hurled through a glass partition
and disappeared with a yell of terror. Every
movable thing in the car leaped toward the front
end; what was breakable broke and the orderly
interior was transformed in an instant to an appalling
chaos.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of what happened in the next minute or two,
the great man never had any very definite recollection.
He staggered to his feet at last and looked
dazedly around. Had there been a wreck? Was
he badly injured?</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he realized that the car was moving, that
the landscape was slipping past as rapidly as ever.
His eyes fell again upon the needle of the indicator.
It stood at sixty-eight. He glared at it for a
moment, unable to believe his senses, then collapsed
into a chair and buried his head in his
hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>And it was in that position that his secretary
found him.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Bill Higgins, the engineer, always claimed it was
because the agent at Roxabel had held him up for
an hour waiting for a box-car to be loaded. The
car was for a friend of the agent’s, Bill explained,
or he never would have held the train. It wasn’t
perishable goods, either—just some household
stuff, which the friend was having moved in from
Roxabel to Loveland.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jim Burns, the conductor, said it was the heat—a
really remarkable and enervating heat for
October, presaging a great storm brewing somewhere.
What the fireman said and the brakemen
is immaterial, because when their superiors went
to sleep, it was to be expected that they would do
likewise. All of which came out when Train Master
Plumfield had them “on the carpet” for the
investigation which followed. What happened was
really this:</p>

<p class='c013'>Local freight west had started out from Wadsworth
early in the morning, to make the trip in to
Cincinnati, picking up such cars as were waiting
for it along the way, and delivering others to the
several stations. The day was hot—there was
no question of that—and the work was heavy, for
there was an unusual number of cars to deliver
and pick up. Besides which, came the delay at
Roxabel, where the agent <i>did</i> hold the train for
a while, until the work of loading a car could be
finished. The agent swore, however, that the delay
on this account did not amount to more than fifteen
minutes. At Lyndon, came an order for the freight
to proceed to the gravel-pit siding east of Greenfield,
and run in there and await the passage of
a special.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t say how long we’ll have to wait,” said
Burns, as he and the engineer compared notes.
“Jest wait—time ain’t no object to nobody. We’ll
be mighty lucky if we get into Cincinnati before
midnight.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Them dispatchers don’t know their business,
an’ never did!” protested Higgins, wiping the perspiration
from his red face. “It’s an outrage to
keep a train on the road the way they’re keepin’
us. The government ort t’ hear about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It sure ort,” agreed the conductor. “Well,
I guess we’re ready,” and as the train rattled slowly
out of the siding, he swung himself aboard the
caboose, looked back to see that a yard-man closed
the switch, and then, having made up his report
as far as he could, calmly laid himself down in a
berth and went to sleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>The train rumbled on under the hot sun. The
engineer, looking ahead, could see the waves of
heat rising from the rails and the pitch oozing from
the ties. Beside him, the fire beneath the boiler
spat and roared; the sun beat down upon the great
locomotive, until Higgins almost fancied it was
turning red-hot before his eyes. The fireman,
stripped to the waist, swung the fire-box door open
and shut as he ladled in the coal, stopping now and
then to dash the sweat from before his eyes or to
spray himself with water from the tank. For they
were travelling with the wind, not against it, and
so lost the effect of any cooling breeze.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blamed if you’d think she’d need so much coal,”
remarked the front brakeman, who was riding in
the cab. “You’d think this heat would purty nigh
git up steam without any help.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You don’t know this blamed old hog,” said the
fireman, referring to the engine. “She eats up
coal like a trans-Atlantic liner. I’ve thought sometimes
they wasn’t no front end to her fire-box, an’
that I was jest shovellin’ coal out into creation.
She’s a caution, she is!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, she ain’t so bad,” put in Higgins, who like
all engineers, loved his engine in spite of her faults.
“You’re jest a-talkin’, Pinkey.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh!” grunted Pinkey. “You trade jobs
with me awhile an’ see.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But to this absurd proposal the engineer returned
no answer. Instead, he tooted the whistle for a
crossing, and, his hand on the throttle, watched a
nervous farmer whip a team of horses across the
track.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blamed fool!” he muttered. “Couldn’t wait
till we got past! Well, there’s the sidin’,” he
added, and stopped until the brakeman had run
ahead and thrown the switch. Then he ran slowly
in.</p>

<p class='c013'>The brakeman closed the switch, and swung
himself up into the caboose. He found the conductor
and rear brakemen peacefully sleeping, and
without disturbing them, clambered up into the
cupola, intending to keep a lookout for the special,
and open the switch after it had passed, so that
the freight could pass out again upon the main
track and proceed upon its way. For a few minutes,
his eyes remained fixed upon the track ahead;
then his lids gradually drooped, his head nodded,
and finally fell forward upon his arms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Forward in the engine, the engineer and fireman
settled themselves upon their respective boxes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long do we have t’ wait?” inquired the
latter, after a few moments.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blamed if I know,” answered the engineer.
“That fool dispatcher didn’t say. But it can’t be
more’n ten minutes. If it had been, he’d have let
us go on to Greenfield.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The minutes passed; and, finally, lulled by the
quiet breathing of the engine, the purr of insects,
and the distant rattle of a mowing machine, both
engineer and fireman nodded off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Twenty minutes later, the engineer awoke with
a start, just in time, as he thought, to hear the roar
of a train fade away in the distance. He glanced
at his watch, then got down from his seat, and
shook the fireman with no gentle hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goin’ t’ stay here all day, Pinkey?” he asked.
“An’ what’s the matter with them blame fools back
there?” he added, savagely, and seizing the whistle
cord, blew three shrill blasts. A moment later, the
front brakeman, who had started awake at the first
blast, came running forward over the train and
clambered down into the cab.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why don’t some o’ you ijits open that there
switch back there,” demanded Higgins, “so’s I kin
back out? Or do you want t’ stay here the rest
o’ your natural lives?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why don’t you pull straight out?” asked the
brakeman. “What’s th’ use o’ backin’ up?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, that there switch has been out o’ fix fer
three months,” answered Higgins, savagely. “I’ve
reported it a dozen times, but much good it does.
Burns knows it. He knows we’ve got t’ back out.
Why don’t he wake up? Is he deef?” and he
jerked the whistle fiercely again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Conductor and brakeman in the caboose were
having a discussion of much the same tenor. Then
Burns remembered about the broken switch.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ve got t’ back out,” he said. “Higgins ’s
right. Git her open,” and as the brakeman threw
the switch, he signalled the engineer to back up.</p>

<p class='c013'>The front brakeman, meanwhile, being of an inquiring
disposition, had dropped off the engine and
walked forward to the other switch, to see just
what the matter was with it. To his surprise, he
found it in perfect working order, for the section
gang had repaired it the afternoon before. Chuckling
to himself, he opened and closed it two or
three times, thinking what a good joke he had on
Burns and Higgins. Then, looking back, he saw
that his train had passed out upon the main track
and was steaming toward him.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>He closed the switch and was just about to lock
it, when he heard another sound that made his heart
stand still—the roar of a train approaching from
the west. The next instant it flashed into view
around the curve, running, as the brakeman afterwards
expressed it, about three hundred miles a
minute.</p>

<p class='c013'>Without conscious thought, but seizing the one
chance in a thousand to avoid a terrible accident,
he threw the switch open again and then sprang
aside as the special swept in upon the siding. He
heard the screaming of the brakes and saw the
train fairly buckling upon itself in an almost human
effort to stop. But stop it could not, and out upon
the main track again it swept, through the switch
at the farther end of the siding, which the brakeman
there had sense enough to open, and on toward
Wadsworth.</p>

<p class='c013'>Staring after it, they saw it pick up speed again,
and disappear.</p>

<p class='c013'>And it was a mighty solemn train crew that took
that local freight in to Greenfield.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>S<span class='sc'>hould</span> Allan West live for a hundred years,
he will never forget that instant in which he closed
his eyes and braced himself for the terrific shock
he knew must come. There was no time to think,
no time even for the sensation of fear to make
itself felt; only a sort of dim realization that the
end was at hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he felt the engine give a mighty lurch,
which almost tore it from the rails; a roar sounded
in his ears, there was another lurch, and opening
his eyes, at last, he saw only the straight track
ahead of him, and felt the engine gradually gaining
speed as Michaels released the brakes and slowly
opened the throttle.</p>

<p class='c013'>He sat erect with a gasp of amazement, and
wiped the sweat from his forehead with shaking
hand. He looked down at the fireman, who had
phlegmatically resumed his duties; then over at the
engineer, who was gazing straight ahead of him,
his face set and gray.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What happened?” he shouted, as the fireman
closed the fire-box and stood resting for a moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blamed if I know,” the latter answered. “I
was shovellin’ in coal, when Bill clapped on the
brakes and purty nigh throwed me into the fire-box.
Then we passed a freight an’ Bill let her out
again. He must ’a’ thought she was on the same
track.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She <i>was</i> on the same track,” said Allan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we passed her, anyway,” retorted the
fireman, philosophically, and returned to his duties.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Allan remembered the switch and understood
dimly what had happened. But it was not
until the investigation was held that he knew all
the details.</p>

<p class='c013'>The crew of the freight were, of course, hauled
up “on the carpet.” The two brakemen who had
opened the switches at the proper instant and
shunted the special past were commended for their
prompt action, and exonerated from blame, as the
train was, of course, in charge of the conductor
and engineer. The two latter worthies were suspended
indefinitely without pay.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was by no means the first time in the history
of the road that a freight crew had gone to sleep
on a siding and waked up to find that they no longer
knew what their rights were. The proper thing to
have done, of course, was either to have flagged
in to the next station, or to have hunted up the nearest
telephone and found out from the dispatchers’
office just what their rights were.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That front brakeman will make a good railroad
man,” remarked Mr. Plumfield, when the inquiry
into the incident was over, taking a little red,
leather-bound book from a drawer of his desk.
“He’s quick-witted—no man ever lasted very long
with a railroad who wasn’t.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He ran down the index at the front of the book,
turned to the names of the four men who had just
been on the carpet, and wrote a short sentence after
each of them. That record would stand to commend
or condemn them so long as they were connected
with the road. The record of every man
was there, with all his merits and demerits. Train
masters might forget—might be promoted or discharged—but
that record always remained.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” went on the train master, restoring the
book to its drawer, “if a railroad man’s wits aren’t
hung on hair-triggers and quicker than greased
lightning in action, he’s usually knocked into Kingdom
Come before he has a chance to realize he
never was cut out for the work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And Mr. Plumfield was right. A railroad man
must learn to act without stopping to think—he
seldom has time to think. Perhaps if he had, he
wouldn’t be so ready to risk his life as he is—for
he risks his life a thousand times to a soldier’s
once—but he always does it in a hurry. There
is no long waiting under fire until the welcome
order comes to charge—if there were, the railroad
man would probably run away, and so would the
soldier, but for the iron discipline that binds him.
That’s what discipline is for—to hold men firm
in the face of realized and long-continued danger—for
there is nothing on earth more difficult than
to make men stand still and be shot at. The railroad
man never has to stand still—he has to jump,
and jump quick. All men aren’t heroes, but their
first impulse is usually to do the brave and necessary
thing. Railroad men always act on that first
impulse—and think about it and shiver over it
and wonder at themselves afterwards.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Despite the misadventure, the special swept into
Wadsworth on time, having covered ninety miles in
ninety minutes—a record which has never been
equalled, or even, for that matter, very nearly approached.
For never since has a train been sent
over the road under such orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>A crowd had gathered at the Wadsworth station
to receive the great man, confident that he would,
at least, favour them with one of those scintillating
three-minute talks for which he was so famous.
So they gathered about the rear platform of his
car yelling “Speech! speech!” For a time there
was no response, then, finally, the door opened, but
it was not the great man who appeared. It was
his secretary, looking very white and shaky. He
apologized for the great man in a thin and tremulous
voice; the trip had been a very trying one,
and the great man was suffering from the strain
incident to the vigorous campaign he had been
waging. He was lying down, endeavouring to get
some much-needed rest, recognizing the necessity
of saving himself for the final struggle which was
to bring New York safe into line and assure an
administration whose first effort it would be, etc.,
etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>The crowd gave a few subdued cheers and melted
away. Then the secretary leaped down the steps of
the car and rushed up to Allan, who was watching
the process of changing engines.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you in charge here?” asked the secretary.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m putting this special through, if that’s what
you mean,” answered Allan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said the secretary, “you’re wanted in
the private car at once.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well,” said Allan, and sprang up the
steps behind him.</p>

<p class='c013'>The great man was half-sitting, half-lying in a
large chair. His face was gray and sunken and
his eyes strangely bloodshot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is the man in charge,” said the secretary,
bringing Allan to a halt before the chair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I just want to tell you one thing,” said the
great man, hoarsely, lifting a trembling finger,
“and that is that if you’re all crazy out here I’m
not! The man who brought us over that last
stretch of road ought to be in an asylum.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We made the ninety miles in ninety minutes,”
said Allan, with some pride.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I won’t stand for anything more of that
sort. Give me your word not to exceed fifty miles
an hour at any time, or I’ll get off the train.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well, sir,” answered Allan. “Will you
put it in writing?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In writing? What for?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My orders are to push the engines for all
they’re worth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The great man swore a mighty oath.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jim, give me a sheet of paper,” he said to his
secretary. And a moment later the order was written,
in a sprawly scribble:</p>

<p class='c016'>“October 15, 19—</p>
<p class='c013'>“This special will hereafter at no time exceed
a speed of fifty (50) miles per hour.</p>
<p class='c017'>“Signed, ————”</p>
<p class='c013'>And Allan still has that order, neatly framed,
hanging over his desk.</p>

<p class='c013'>He hurried away and modified the train-orders,
so that Clem Johnson, the engineer who was to take
the special from Wadsworth to Parkersburg, suddenly
lost all interest in life and climbed into his
cab in a towering rage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lost his nerve,” he said to his fireman, with a
jerk of his head toward the private car. “An’ I
don’t suppose they’ll be any runnin’ on the same
road with Michaels no more—he’ll have the swell-head
so bad. It’s tough luck—that’s what I call
it—mighty tough luck.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Them fellers never do have any sand,” observed
the fireman, contemptuously. “We’d ’a’
beat Michaels’s time easy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“O’ course we would!” growled the engineer.
“An’ now we’ve got t’ crawl along like a funeral
percession. I’ll show him!” and he pulled the
throttle open viciously, so that the train started
with a jerk that caused the great man to jump with
alarm.</p>

<p class='c013'>The engineer observed his orders not to exceed
fifty miles an hour, but the trip was not a pleasant
one, for all that; for he took a savage delight in
banging and jerking the train, so that even the
great private car felt the uneven motion, and
swayed and groaned and jumped in a manner which
reduced its distinguished occupant to the verge
of prostration. Finally he called the conductor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the matter with this track, anyway?”
he demanded. “I feel like I was riding over a
corduroy road. Has there been an earthquake, or
what?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir,” answered the conductor, who understood
what the engineer was doing and was delighted
thereat. “There ain’t been no earthquake.
The track is perfectly smooth, sir. I don’t think
the engine’s working just right—a little uneven.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Uneven!” repeated the great man. “Is that
the best word you can find for it? It reminds me
of a bucking broncho! Heavens!” and he buried
his face in his hands again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh!” grunted the conductor to himself, as
he withdrew. “Lost his nerve!”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was true. The great man had lost his nerve.
Not for weeks did he regain his usual tone. The
leaders in New York were greatly disappointed
by his lack of “ginger;” his speeches did not have
that telling quality they had possessed of old—in
a word, he lost New York State and the Presidency—and
all, perhaps, because a freight crew went
to sleep on a siding out in Ohio. An incident,
surely, to rank with the spider that saved Mahomet
or the whinny which made Darius King of Persia.</p>

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c006'>CHAPTER V <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>THE NEW TIME-CARD</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>S<span class='sc'>o</span>, day by day, the work at the dispatchers’ office
went on in its accustomed routine. Always there
was the clatter of the keys, always the trains pulling
in and out of the yards, always the coming and
going of men like a mighty and well-disciplined
army. They were servants of the mightiest industrial
force in the world, the thing which had done
most for the development of commerce, the advancement
of trade—the thing without which, in
a word, the world of to-day would not be possible.
Few people realize the tremendous business done
by the railroads of the world. In the United States
alone, in a single year, besides the eight hundred
million passengers carried, a billion and a half tons
of freight are moved, the total passenger and
freight mileage reaching the inconceivable total of
two hundred and forty-two billion, for which the
roads received nearly two and a half billion dollars,
or more than twice the amount of the national debt.
Figures like that, of course, make no impression on
the mind—they are too vast, too grandiose for
human comprehension.</p>

<p class='c013'>And the gigantic task of moving this freight
and these passengers goes on from day to day, from
hour to hour, in the usual course of things, just as
the sun rises and sets, almost as though operated
by a law of nature and not by man’s exertion, by
the law of gravitation and not in defiance of it.
And just as people grow accustomed to the miracle
of sunrise and cease to wonder at it, so they grow
accustomed to the miracle of steam. Only those
who, day by day, do battle to keep the great machine
in operation realize fully what a desperate
battle it is. Allan West was soon to have a personal
experience with a vital part of the mechanism
with which he had never before come in contact.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Allan,” Superintendent Schofield said one
morning, stopping beside his desk, “we’ve got our
new time-card about ready, and I wish you’d arrange
to-morrow so you can come and help us
string the chart.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“String the chart?” repeated Allan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes. It’ll interest you—besides, it’s something
you ought to know. We’re going to throw
Number Two half an hour later, and make one or
two other changes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan knew that the “time-card meeting” had
been held at Cincinnati a few days before. Indeed,
Mr. Schofield had talked over with him the projected
changes, and the reasons for them.</p>

<p class='c013'>For it must be understood that railroads everywhere
are striving ceaselessly to arrange their
time-cards to meet the needs of the public and
to secure the greatest possible economy of operation.
It is foolish for a road to run two trains
when one will do, but while the number of trains
is cut to a minimum, they must be run at such
hours as will be convenient to the public which
they serve, otherwise they won’t get the traffic. A
certain number of people, of course, have to travel
every day, whether the trains run at convenient
hours or not; but with a much greater number
travel is a matter of pleasure, of choice, and with
them convenience has great weight—much greater
than one would suppose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus, in the vicinity of a great city, there must
be locals going in in the morning and coming out
in the afternoon, so that “commuters” may get
back and forth to work, and shoppers may be accommodated.
These trains must be sufficient in
number to meet the demand, and must be run at
such hours as will suit the different classes of people
they serve. If the train-service is bad, the
“commuters” will move, if they can, to a place
where it is better—where they can get to and from
work more cheaply and easily. Rents will go down
in the district which is badly served, real estate will
decrease in value, an undesirable class of people
will move into it, and the traffic from it will drop
away to little or nothing. So the road, by carelessness
at the beginning, brings its own punishment
surely at the end.</p>

<p class='c013'>Further, it is immaterial as to the time that the
through trains pass these points, since they gather
practically no traffic from them. A through train
considers only its terminals—when is the best time
for it to leave New York and arrive at Cincinnati.
Can such a train be arranged to leave New York
after business hours and arrive at Pittsburgh before
them? Two great roads are at the present time
running trains between New York and Chicago
with the boast that one can go from one city to
the other without losing an hour of the business
day.</p>

<p class='c013'>So with through trains, the most important object
is to shorten the running time as much as possible.
The “locals” can take care of the short-haul
traffic, and their hours can be accommodated
to it; but the through trains must get from terminus
to terminus, with regard only to the time
of leaving and arriving.</p>

<p class='c013'>In consequence, time-cards are constantly changing.
Perhaps a curve has been straightened, or a
tunnel completed that saves a long detour; perhaps
a grade has been lowered, an old bridge replaced
with a new one—such changes as these every road
is constantly making. And time-cards change with
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Or perhaps faster and heavier engines are purchased,
and a complete change of time-card is at
once rendered necessary. For every through train
runs as fast as it can run with safety. And as a
road grows older, and time-card after time-card is
made out, the running time of the trains is made
more and more perfect, until there are long
stretches where the engineer does not have to touch
his throttle, so exactly does the running time of
the train correspond with the best the engine can
do. The passenger who remarks to a companion
upon the smoothness of the running, and who
glances with approbation at his watch as the train
pulls into its destination exactly on time, does not
know what patient and long experimenting it took
to achieve that result.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>“Ya-as,” drawled old Bill Williams, sarcastically,
when I read the above paragraph to him.
“Ya-as, that’s all very pretty in theory—but how
about the practice, my boy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I had to confess that I was weak in practice.
But I knew that Bill was strong, for he had served
over forty years at the throttle before an affection
of the eyes had caused him to retire from active
service and to open a railroad boarding-house, by
means of which he still managed to keep in touch
with the life of the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wa-al,” he went on, taking a deliberate chew
of tobacco, and putting his feet up on the railing
of the veranda which ran across the front of the
Williams House, “theory an’ practice air two
mighty different things. Time-cards is usually
built on theory, an’ it’s up to the engineer t’ maintain
’em in practice. The trouble is that time-cards
is made out fer engines in puffect condition, which
not one in ten is. So the engineer has to make
up fer the faults of his engine—a good deal like
a good rider’ll lift his hoss over a five-barred gate,
where a bad one’ll come a cropper every time. So
when y’ see a train that’s come a thousand mile,
pull in on time to the minute, don’t you go an’ make
the mistake o’ thinkin’ it was the engine, or the
time-card, or even the dispatchers what did it,
’cause it wasn’t. It was the crews what brought
thet there train through in spite o’ wind an’ weather
an’ other folkses mistakes.”</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Nevertheless, even Bill would admit, I think, the
necessity of carefully and intelligently prepared
time-cards, and certainly there was no one item in
the operation of the road to which the officials gave
such close and continued attention. Two or three
meetings were held at the general offices at Cincinnati,
at which all of the officials of the transportation
department, as well as the general officials,
were present. Here, with data carefully collected,
it was decided how many passenger and
freight trains were to be run, what changes of time
were desirable, and at what hour and minute each
train was to leave and arrive at the termini of the
division. It now remained to provide the meeting-points
for these trains, and this task was left to
the division officials at Wadsworth. It was this
ceremony, known as “stringing the chart,” at
which Allan had been invited to assist.</p>

<p class='c013'>The chart itself was a large map about five feet
high by eight wide, covered with numberless parallel
lines. Across the top and bottom of the board,
at equal distances, were twenty-four numbers, representing
the twenty-four hours. They began at
twelve midnight, ran up to twelve noon, and then
to twelve midnight again. From top to bottom of
the board, connecting these numbers, perpendicular
lines were drawn. The space between the numbers
was then divided into twelve equal parts, and
lighter lines drawn connecting them. The space
between every two of these lines therefore represented
five minutes, and there were 288 of them
running across the board from top to bottom.</p>

<p class='c013'>On each side of the board at the top, and on a
line with the top row of numbers, the word “Cincinnati”
was printed. At the bottom of the board,
on either side, and in line with the numbers there,
was the word “Parkersburg.” These are the termini
of the division, and they are 195.3 miles apart.
Then along each side of the board the names of
all the stations of the line were printed, the distances
between them and the termini being carefully
figured out so that the distances on the board should
be exactly proportionate to the real distances. Horizontal
lines were then drawn across the board, connecting
the names of the same station, and the time-chart
was complete.</p>

<p class='c013'>Usually it was stored in a back room, out of the
way, carefully covered so that it would be kept
clean. On the morning in question, however, it was
uncovered, carefully wiped off, and then wheeled
into the superintendent’s office, where the ceremony
of stringing it was to be performed. Mr. Schofield
was there, and the train master, and Allan, eager
to see the process. On the superintendent’s desk
lay two balls of string, one white and one red, and
a note-book in which had been jotted down the
time assigned to each train.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I guess we’re ready to begin,” said Mr.
Schofield, picking up the white ball and stepping
before the chart. “We’ll string the east-bound
trains first,” he added.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let it be said here that east-bound trains are
always indicated by even numbers and west-bound
trains by odd ones. Thus, on any road, “Number
Four,” for instance, will always be an east-bound
train, and “Number Three” will always be a west-bound
one. In addition to which, it should be remembered
that east-bound trains always have right
of way over west-bound trains of the same class.
That is to say, when an east-bound and west-bound
first-class passenger train meet, it is the
west-bound train which runs in on a siding and
waits until the other sweeps by on the main
track.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now,” continued Mr. Schofield, “we’ll begin
with Number Four, which has rights over everything.
Look at those notes, Allan, and tell me at
what time it is to leave Cincinnati.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At 12.15 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>,” said Allan, picking up the
note-book.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Correct. Now this line running up and down
across the centre of the board is for twelve o’clock
noon. This third line after it is for 12.15, five
minutes for each line. This line across the top of
the board is for Cincinnati, so I drive a pin there
and loop the end of this cord around it, so,” and
he suited the action to the word. “Now, at what
time does Number Four reach Wadsworth?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At 3.05,” answered Allan, looking at the notes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well—see, here is the 3.05 line, and here,
running across the board, about midway down, is
the Wadsworth line. I drive another pin at the
intersection of these two lines, draw the cord tight
and loop it about this second pin. And now
what?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The train stops at Wadsworth five minutes to
change engines,” said Allan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So I drive a third pin right out along this
Wadsworth line at the intersection of it and the
3.10 o’clock line. Now, what time does it reach
Parkersburg?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At 5.50 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, here’s the 5.50 line, and here, at the bottom
of the board, is the Parkersburg line. I drive
a fourth pin there, draw the cord tight and tie it.
Then I cut it off, and tie at the end this little tag
marked ‘Number Four.’ Now what does that cord
indicate?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan, looking at the board, saw a line that ran
roughly like this:</p>

<div id='p057'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/p057.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>(For complete time-table, see diagram facing <a href='#p076'>page 60</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Why,” he answered, after a moment, his eyes
shining, “the cord indicates the exact time that the
train passes every station along the line.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Exactly,” assented Mr. Schofield. “Now, just
by way of illustration, we’ll put on a west-bound
train next,” and he picked up the red ball. “We’ll
take Number Three. At what time does it leave
Parkersburg?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At 11.40 <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So I drive the pin here. When does it reach
Wadsworth?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At 2.20 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So the pin goes here. It stays there five minutes,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—just like Number Four.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So another pin goes here. When does it reach
Cincinnati?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At 5.35 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And here’s the fourth pin—and there’s your
red string across the board, indicating Number
Three. Now look at them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Here is what Allan saw:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/p058.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>Time-Table</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“You notice the two strings cross at the 2.45
line,” continued Mr. Schofield, “between Musselman
and Roxabel. What does that mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It means the trains will meet there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But they can’t meet out there on a single track.
They’ve got to meet at a station where there’s a
siding. So we’ve got to hold Number Three at
Musselman three minutes until Number Four can
get past—in other words, we’ve got to change the
red string a little, like this,” and he drove another
pin on the 2.42 line at Musselman, and tied the red
string to it. “That provides a meeting place for
those two trains. Now let’s go ahead with the
others.”</p>

<p class='c013'>White strings representing all the east-bound
passenger trains were put on the board in the same
way. All of them ran more or less parallel with
each other, the faster trains inclining more toward
the perpendicular and the slower trains more
toward the horizontal. To each string was attached
a little tag bearing the number of the train,
and that being done, the superintendent declared
it was time to adjourn for lunch.</p>

<p class='c013'>An hour later, the work of stringing the west-bound
passenger trains was taken up, the red cord
being used to represent them. As they necessarily
ran in the opposite direction, these strings crossed
the strings representing the east-bound trains, and
each of these crossings indicated a meeting-point.
When the strings were first put on the board, it
was found that many of them, as had been the case
with those representing trains Three and Four,
crossed between stations, and as it is against the
rules of all railroading to permit two trains going
in opposite directions to meet on the same track,
the running time of the trains had to be so altered
that the meetings occurred at a station, or at least
at a place where there was a siding, so that one
train could pull in out of the way of the other. The
through passenger trains, which are given preference,
were so timed that they could run from end
to end of the division without getting out of the
way of anything; the accommodations usually had
two or three short waits, but so carefully were these
timed that their passengers would never notice it.
In fact, wherever it was possible, the running time
of the train was extended a few minutes, so that
the delay would be only a minute or two.</p>

<p class='c013'>After all the passenger trains had been placed
on the board and the meeting-points provided for,
the freight trains were added. Meeting-points
with the freight trains had also to be arranged,
but this was comparatively easy, as it was simply
a question of the freight heading in at the last
siding it could reach in advance of the passenger,
and then waiting for the passenger to go by.</p>

<p class='c013'>When every train had been placed on the board
and every meeting-point provided for, the time at
which every train arrived at and left every station
was carefully noted down.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And that’s done,” said Mr. Schofield, with a
sigh of satisfaction. “It’s a big job, and I’m
mighty glad we won’t have to do it soon again.
What do you think of it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s great,” Allan answered. “Who thought
it out?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know. It’s been in use for a long time—practically
all roads ‘string the chart,’ just as
we have done. It’s the safest system that has ever
been devised.”</p>

<div id='p076'  class='figcenter id004'>
<a href='images/p076large.jpg'><img src='images/p076.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' /></a>
<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='small'>On this chart only the more important trains are shown. Dotted lines<br />have been used to represent white cords, or east-bound trains, and solid<br />lines to represent red cords, or west-bound trains.</span><br />(Click on image to see a larger version.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t see how any could be safer,” said Allan.
“And I’m awfully glad you showed me how it works.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I’d do that, of course,” laughed the superintendent.
“I want you to know everything there
is to know about railroading. It will all come in
handy some day. Now, I’ll turn these notes over
to the printer, and we’ll have another bout when we
get the proofs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In a few days, the first proof of the new time-card
was returned to Mr. Schofield, and he and
Allan went over it carefully, comparing it with the
chart to make certain that there was no error in
figures and that every meeting-point was provided
for. With the chart to go by, it was impossible that
any meeting-point could be overlooked. A second
proof was treated in the same way, and finally
O.K’d. Then the time-cards were printed—not at
all in the form with which the public is acquainted
with them, but as large oblong pamphlets of twenty-four
pages,—distributed to the road’s employees,
and at twelve o’clock midnight on December 21st,
the new card went into effect. All the public knew
of it was a few lines in the newspapers announcing
that this train or the other would arrive a few
minutes later or earlier than it had been doing, and
most people wondered, if they thought about it at
all, why it had been necessary to get out a new
time-card at all for changes so unimportant.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c006'>CHAPTER VI <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>THE LITTLE CLOUD</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>T<span class='sc'>he</span> installing of a new time-card is not so simple
a thing as one might imagine. For that one night,
every engineer and conductor has to bear in mind
two schedules, the old one and the new one. For,
though the new one goes into effect, technically,
at midnight, it is, of course, impossible that it
should do so in reality. A train, for instance, which
started under the old schedule at 10.50 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> and
which, under the new one, would start fifteen or
twenty minutes earlier, could not, once it was out
on the road, make up that time, so it was compelled
to run by the old schedule until it had finished its
trip, even though that carried it over the time after
which the new schedule went into effect. In other
words, every train which was on the road at midnight,
must continue under the old schedule until
it reached its destination.</p>

<p class='c013'>So that night was always one of anxiety. Trainmen,
who often get mixed on a single schedule, are
only too likely to do so on a double one!</p>

<p class='c013'>It so happened, however, that the exciting events
of that night were not due to forgetfulness, but to
a danger which no one could foresee or guard
against, and which is, in consequence, one most
feared by railroad men. And it developed the
latent heroism in two men in a way which is still
talked of on the rail, where these tales are passed
on from mouth to mouth wherever trainmen congregate.</p>

<p class='c013'>The night was a cold and windy one, with a
swirl of snow now and then, just sufficient to obscure
the slippery track ahead, and yet not dense
enough to cause the engineer to abandon in despair
the task of trying to see what he was driving into.
As a consequence, Engineer Jim Adams, pulling
first section of through freight No. 98, had strained
his eyes until they ached, in the effort to descry
track and signals. More than once his hand had
trembled on the throttle, as he fancied he saw another
headlight gleaming through the mist ahead,
but which, at the last instant, resolved itself into
a reflection of his own. So when an unmistakable
red glow did appear there, he waited an instant
and batted his eyes savagely once or twice before
he threw on the brakes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s the Jones Run bridge!” yelled the front
brakeman, who, perched on the fireman’s seat, had
seen the glare at the same instant. “Git out o’
here!” And jumping to the floor of the cab, he
balanced himself an instant in the gangway and
then sprang out into the darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fireman took one look at the swirling flames
ahead and followed him. Then the engineer, having
set the brakes and closed the throttle, also leaped
out into the darkness. But even as he leaped, he
suddenly realized that the train had just impetus
enough to carry it to the bridge. It would stop
there, be consumed, and the loss to the company
would be thousands and thousands of dollars.</p>

<p class='c013'>By a supreme effort, he landed on his feet, and
then, running a step or two, managed to catch the
hand-hold on the first freight car, as it passed him.
In a minute, he had clambered up the ladder, over
the coal in the tender and down into the cab again,
where he released the brakes, opened the throttle
wide, and started on a wild run for the bridge. In
an instant, the flames were around him and he felt
the bridge shake and sway, but it held, and the
train crossed in safety.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile, back in the caboose, a strange scene
was enacting. The brakeman and conductor, who
had been cosily sleeping in their bunks, were suddenly
thrown out to the floor by a terrific impact,
and every loose object seemed to be hurling itself
toward the front end of the car. It took a minute
for them to disentangle themselves and get to their
feet again. Then they made a simultaneous rush
for the door, just as the brakes were released and
the train jerked forward again. The conductor
opened the door and started to put his head out
to see what was the matter, when he suddenly found
himself surrounded by a swirl of flame.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh all whittaker!” he yelled, and slammed
the door shut again. Then he jumped for the box
of fusees which every caboose carries.</p>

<p class='c013'>The brakeman, who was green, was too frightened
even to be interested. Otherwise he would
have seen the conductor jerk out two fusees, and
then, opening the door again, drop off the train just
as it cleared the bridge. He scrambled down the
bank, and, holding the fusees high over his head,
plunged into the icy water without an instant’s
hesitation, and then, stopping only to light one of
the fusees at a glowing ember, raced wildly away
down the track, waving it above his head. For he
had remembered the second section following close
behind; he knew that the bridge would be so weakened
that another train could not cross it; feared
that, in the swirling snow, the engineer might not
see the flames until too late; and instantly took the
only effective means to stop the oncoming train.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stop it he did, of course, and after making sure
the bridge could not be saved, both trains flagged
their way to the nearest stations to give word of
the disaster. Ten hours later, a temporary bridge
replaced the old one, and traffic was running as
usual.</p>

<p class='c013'>An investigation of the cause of the fire followed
a few days later, but nothing definite concerning
it could be discovered. It might have started, as
so many do, from ashes dropped from the fire-box
of a passing train; or it might have been set on
fire by tramps, either by accident or design. Orders
were at once sent in for an iron bridge to
replace the wooden one, so that a repetition of the
accident would be impossible.</p>

<p class='c013'>One thing, however, resulted from the investigation—the
indication of possible carelessness on
the part of another engineer. Half an hour before
the first section of ninety-eight had passed, the
evening accommodation had crossed the bridge. It
seemed impossible that the fire should have got such
a headway in that time, and the presumption
strongly was that the bridge was on fire when the
passenger train crossed it, and that the engineer was
not attending to his duties, or he would have seen
it. The fireman, engaged in shovelling coal into the
fire-box, and blinded by the glare of the flames,
would probably not have noticed it, and on a passenger
train no brakeman rides in the cab; but it
could not have escaped the eyes of the engineer if
he had been watching the tracks. It was, of course,
possible that he had seen it, but had not stopped
his train or given warning through some motive of
hate or personal revenge; and inquiry, indeed, developed
the fact that there was a bitter quarrel of
long standing between him and Jim Adams, the
engineer of first ninety-eight—but this may have
been merely a coincidence.</p>

<p class='c013'>At any rate, Mr. Plumfield hesitated to think that
any man would have passed the fire from such a
motive, and preferred to believe that the engineer
of the accommodation had merely been remiss.
The engineer, a burly fellow named Rafe Bassett,
stoutly denied that this was the case, and declared
that he had noticed the bridge especially and that
it was all right.</p>

<p class='c013'>Something in his demeanour, however, aroused
Mr. Plumfield’s suspicions. Bassett was perhaps a
trifle too emphatic in his denials. At any rate, he
was suspended without pay.</p>

<p class='c013'>The day after this happened, Mr. Schofield
paused beside the train master’s desk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What was the trouble with Bassett, George?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I can’t say, exactly,” answered Mr. Plumfield.
“But he struck me as being not altogether
on the square. You know he’s been in trouble before,”
and he brought out the little red book.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Schofield nodded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know,” he said. “I’m afraid this is
going to make trouble,” he added, after a moment.
“You know Bassett is a great brotherhood man,
and is one of those big-mouthed agitators who are
always talking about the wrongs of labour. His
lodge is calling a special meeting to-night to consider
his case.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it?” asked Mr. Plumfield, grimly. “Well,
I suppose there’ll be a grievance committee to wait
on me in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And there was. Scarcely had he seated himself
at his desk next day, when three engineers, cap in
hand, appeared at the door and requested an audience.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, boys; come in,” said the train master.
“What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s about Bassett,” explained the spokesman.
“He’s laid off, I hear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said the train master. “Laid off till further
notice.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What for?” asked the spokesman.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Plumfield hesitated. It was rather difficult
to formulate the charge against Bassett.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For knowing more about the burning of the
Jones Run bridge the other night than he’s willing
to tell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you mean he set it on fire?” inquired one
of the men, incredulously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no; but I think he ran past it after it was
on fire and didn’t stop to put it out, as he should
have done.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Does Bassett admit it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, of course not.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why should he run past the fire?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Maybe he was asleep and didn’t see it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And have you any evidence?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“None but his manner,” answered Mr. Plumfield
frankly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said the spokesman, twirling his cap in
his hands, “all I can say is that that’s mighty poor
evidence, it seems to me. We had a meetin’ at the
lodge last night, and we was appointed a committee
to see you and demand that Bassett be reinstated
at once.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” said Mr. Plumfield, “I’ll consider
it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And when can we have our answer?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This afternoon at three o’clock,” answered the
train master sharply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, sir,” said the spokesman of the committee,
and the three men filed out.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Plumfield looked over at Allan, after a moment,
with a little laugh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m afraid those fellows have got me,” he said.
“I’m morally convinced that Bassett’s crooked, but
there’s no way to prove it. I’m afraid I’ll have
to back down. I made a mistake in suspending him
in the first place, but the man’s manner irritated
me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And so, that afternoon, when the committee reappeared,
it was informed that Bassett had been
reinstated as requested.</p>

<p class='c013'>They filed out with ill-concealed triumph on
their faces, and Mr. Plumfield felt uncomfortably
that his mistake had been a serious one. In gaining
a victory, Bassett had enthroned himself more
firmly than ever in the confidence of his associates.</p>

<p class='c013'>Three hours later, in the dusk of the early winter
evening, Mr. Plumfield left his office and started
toward his home. As he crossed the tracks, and
came opposite a saloon which occupied the corner
nearest the station, the door suddenly swung open
and two or three men stumbled out. They were
talking loudly, and as they came under the glare
of the street lamps, Mr. Plumfield saw that one of
them was Bassett. The engineer saw him at the
same moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, here’s the train master,” he cried, lurching
forward. “Well, so ye had t’ crawfish, didn’t
ye, me bird? An’ well fer ye ye did!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bassett,” said Mr. Plumfield, quietly, “you’re
drunk. Take care, or you’ll get a dose a good deal
worse than the last one.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I will, will I?” cried Bassett, coming
closer. “Well, you jest try it! You jest try it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” said Mr. Plumfield. “You don’t
need to report any more. You’re not in the employ
of the P. &amp; O. any longer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ain’t I?” cried Bassett. “Well, we’ll see what
the boys say to that! You heerd this, boys—”</p>

<p class='c013'>But without waiting to hear more, Mr. Plumfield
went on his way. This time, he felt, he would
have to stick to his decision, no matter what happened.
And he felt, too, that he was right.</p>

  <h2 id='ch07' class='c006'>CHAPTER VII <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>A THREAT FROM MR. NIXON</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>T<span class='sc'>he</span> storm was not long in bursting. Again
there was a special meeting of the lodge; again a
grievance committee waited on Mr. Plumfield, but
it met a very different reception from that which
had been given the former one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have just one thing to tell you,” he said, when
he had listened to their complaint, “and that is
that Rafe Bassett will never be given a job on this
road while I’m train master. He was drunk the
other night, and you know it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He denies it,” said the chairman of the committee.
“He admits he’d had a glass or two of
beer, but that ain’t a penitentiary offence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Especially when a man ain’t on duty,” chimed
in another.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And he says he thought he was still suspended,”
chimed in a third, “and he supposed he
could do as he pleased.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He didn’t think anything of the sort,” said
Mr. Plumfield, sharply. “The first words he said
to me were that I’d had to crawfish. So he knew
he’d been reinstated. But he’ll never be reinstated
again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are them your last words, Mr. Plumfield?”
inquired one of his auditors, ominously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, they’re my last words,” retorted the train
master, and turned to his work, while the committee
filed out.</p>

<p class='c013'>He foresaw, of course, what would happen, but
he felt that to reinstate Bassett would for ever
destroy discipline among the men under him. He
stated the case to Mr. Schofield, and that official
agreed with him that Bassett could never be reinstated,
but that the matter must be fought out to
a finish.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hostilities were not long in commencing. The
local lodge made a report—more or less biased—of
the occurrence to the general officials of the
order, and one of the latter came posthaste to the
scene. A day or two later, Mr. Schofield received
the following letter:</p>
<p class='c018'>“<span class='sc'>Wadsworth, Ohio</span>, January 16, 190-</p>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. R. E. Schofield</span>,</p>
<p class='c020'>“<i>Superintendent Ohio Division</i>,</p>
<p class='c021'>“<i>P. &amp; O. Railway</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Dear Sir</i>:—As a representative of the Grand
Lodge of the Independent Order of Railway Engineers,
I ask a conference with you at the earliest
possible moment.</p>
<p class='c017'>“Yours truly,</p>
<p class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>H. F. Nixon</span>,</p>
<p class='c022'>“<i>Special Delegate</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Schofield answered at once, setting the conference
for next day and asking both Mr. Plumfield
and Allan to be present. For he desired some witnesses
of the interview.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nixon showed up promptly at the appointed time.
He was a heavy-set man with a red face and big
black moustache. He wore a sweeping fur overcoat,
and, when he drew off his gloves, a big seal-ring
with diamond settings was visible upon the little
finger of his right hand. Mr. Schofield greeted
him courteously, invited him to take off his overcoat
and sit down, and then stepped to the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bob,” he called to his office boy, “ask Mr.
Plumfield and Mr. West to step this way at once,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Nixon, who had thrown his overcoat across a
chair and got out a big black cigar, paused with it
halfway to his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not calling the company for me, are you?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, yes,” said the superintendent, quietly.
“You’ve come about the Bassett business, haven’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Nixon nodded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, Mr. Plumfield is the one with whom
Bassett had the trouble. I thought you’d like to
hear his story.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, all right,” said Nixon, sitting down and
lighting his cigar. “Only I know the story already.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Maybe you’ve only heard one side of it,” suggested
Mr. Schofield, smiling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, maybe I have,” assented Nixon, and
when Mr. Plumfield and Allan entered, he greeted
them with a fair degree of cordiality.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now, Mr. Plumfield,” said the superintendent,
when the introductions were over, “I wish
you would tell Mr. Nixon exactly what happened
between you and Bassett.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So the train master told the story of his encounter
with the drunken engineer, while Nixon sat back
in his chair puffing his cigar meditatively, and nodding
from time to time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know, of course,” he said, when Mr.
Plumfield had finished, “that Bassett denies he was
drunk, and so do the boys who were with him. He
admits that he’d had a glass or two of beer, but
there’s nothing against that, is there, when a man’s
off duty?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a rule against the use of intoxicants,”
replied the superintendent, slowly, “and against a
man’s being impudent on duty or off.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And there’s no prospect of your taking Bassett
back?” asked Nixon.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the slightest,” answered Mr. Schofield.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose you know what that means?” inquired
Nixon, blowing out a puff of smoke and
gazing at it with half-closed eyes, as it floated
slowly upwards.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What does it mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It means a strike.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is the brotherhood as foolish as all that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The brotherhood is bound to protect the interests
of all its members.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Even those who don’t deserve it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The brotherhood must decide who’s worthy
and who’s not. It can’t let outsiders do it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, all right,” said Mr. Schofield. “It’s up
to you. I guess we can get some more engineers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, you’ll need more than engineers,” said
Nixon, easily. “You’ll need firemen and brakemen
and conductors and switchmen—the whole
force, in fact.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The superintendent sat staring at his visitor, his
brows knitted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You mean they’ll strike in sympathy?” he
asked, at last.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Exactly,” and Nixon smiled blandly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What kind of fools are railroad men anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll tell you how it is,” said Nixon. “Railroad
men realize that they’ve got to stand together. You
remember those spell-binders who used to go around
hollering ‘My country, right or wrong!’ Well,
that’s our principle. Besides, the time’s ripe for a
strike.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I mean there hasn’t been a real strike for some
time an’ the boys are ready for a little excitement.
You see, we’ve found a better way than strikin’,
but not half so interestin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think I know what you mean,” said Mr. Schofield,
slowly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—I guess you do. We’ve found out that
we can get legislatures to pass most any law we
want. It’s different from the old days, when the
railroads carried the legislatures in their pockets.
The pendulum’s swung the other way. Now it’s
as much as a man’s life’s worth to vote for a railroad
measure or against one that railroad employees
ask for. So things come our way easy.
Besides, that anti-pass law has hurt you bad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, it has,” Mr. Schofield agreed, with a grim
smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was a mighty cheap and convenient way of
buyin’ influence,” continued Nixon. “For a thousand
or two miles of mileage, you got seven-eighths
of the legislatures without further expense. They
didn’t consider it takin’ a bribe. Now even money
won’t do the trick. You’re up a tree.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, we are,” agreed the superintendent, “until
the pendulum swings back again. You fellows
are too eager. You’re killing the goose.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I guess we’ll get our share of the eggs,”
grinned Nixon. “Have you heard of the latest?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The latest?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The caboose bill?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said Mr. Schofield. “What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Nixon, chuckling to himself, “the
railroads, as you know, never waste a thought on
the comfort or safety of their employees—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, of course not,” agreed Mr. Schofield, ironically.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All they think of is earnings an’ big salaries
for the officers. One of the most inhuman afflictions
which freight conductors and brakemen have
to put up with in modern times is the caboose.
Have you ever ridden in a caboose?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hundreds of times!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I forgot,” said Nixon, grinning, “I
thought I was addressin’ the legislature. I was
goin’ to paint for them the torture of ridin’ in a
caboose, the impossibility of sleepin’ there; how a
few years of it wrecks a man’s health, and so
forth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see you’re a good hand at fancy pictures,”
said the superintendent, drily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A man has to be to hold my job,” said Nixon,
with a broad grin. “But, cuttin’ all that out, the
bill compels the railroads to use no caboose less’n
forty feet in length. The berths must be comfortable
an’ sanitary, with the sheets changed every
trip. There must be all the toilet conveniences—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why not compel us to hitch a Pullman to every
freight train, with porter and everything complete?”
inquired the superintendent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no,” protested Nixon, waving his hand.
“We’re reasonable. We don’t want anything but
our rights.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Schofield’s face was flushed and he opened
his lips for an angry retort, but thought better of
it and closed them again. Then he laughed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” he said. “Go ahead. Kill the
goose. But were you serious about that strike?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never more serious in my life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When will it be called?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When I give the word,” said Nixon, “not before.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And he cast at the superintendent a glance full
of meaning.</p>

<p class='c013'>The latter stared at him, then down at his desk,
drumming with absent fingers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” he said, at last, looking up, “don’t call
it for a couple of days. I’ll have to ask instructions
from headquarters.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” agreed Nixon, rising and slipping
into his coat. “Let me see—this is Wednesday.
I’ll come in Friday morning at this time for your
answer. How’ll that suit?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Schofield nodded curtly, and with a bland
wave of the hand to the others, Nixon went to the
door and let himself out.</p>

<p class='c013'>The superintendent gazed moodily at the closed
door for a moment, then he rose and walked to the
window and stared down over the yards.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” he said at last, turning back to the
others, “there are three courses open.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Three?” repeated Mr. Plumfield, in evident
surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, three. In the first place, we can back
down and reinstate Bassett.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the second place, we can refuse to do it and
fight it out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And in the third place we can avoid either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By bribing Nixon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bribing Nixon?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes. You heard him say that there wouldn’t
be any strike until he called it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you didn’t see how he looked at me when
he said it. If ever a man invited a bribe, without
putting the invitation in so many words, he did.
A thousand dollars would do it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you won’t offer it!” cried Allan eagerly.
“You won’t do that!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said Mr. Schofield, smiling as he looked
at the flushed face. “I won’t do it. I’m going to
advise a fight. But the decision doesn’t rest with
me. I’ll have to go to Cincinnati in the morning
and take it up with the general manager.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But to give a bribe—” Allan began.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds bad, doesn’t it? And yet I don’t think
the general manager will waste much time thinking
about the moral side of it. That’s not what he’s
there for. He’s there to work for the best interests
of the road. A strike is sure to cost us a good
many times a thousand dollars—how many times
nobody can tell till it’s over. Which is best for the
road?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan’s head was whirling. After all, there was
truth in what Mr. Schofield said. The only question
for the general manager to consider was just
that—what was best for the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Schofield turned from the window and
looked at him again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I tell you what,” he said, suddenly, “I’d like
to have you go along. Will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go along?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And hear the other side of it. It’ll do you
good, and maybe it’ll do us good to have you,” he
added.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll be glad to,” answered Allan, his face flushing
suddenly, and hastened back to his desk to get
things in shape so that he could be absent on the
morrow.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>MR. ROUND’S DECISION</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>A<span class='sc'>nd</span> so it happened that Allan arose next morning
about two hours earlier than usual, in order to
catch the five o’clock train for Cincinnati. It reminded
him of the far-off days when he was taking
his trick of track-walking in the early morning.
As he came down the stairs, he saw a yellow band
of light under the kitchen door, and he heard somebody
clattering about within. He opened the door
to find Mary already busy with the kitchen stove.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, Allan,” she said, “what’re ye doin’ up
so early?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got to go to Cincinnati on Number One,”
he answered. “I’ll be back on Two to-night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why didn’t ye tell me last night?” she demanded.
“I’d ’a’ had your breakfast ready.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know you would,” Allan answered, looking at
the patient, kindly face. “That’s the reason I
didn’t say anything. I’ll get breakfast on the diner.
Good-bye,” and snatching up hat and overcoat, he
was off.</p>

<p class='c013'>He reached the station just as the train was pulling
in and found Mr. Schofield awaiting him. Together
they clambered into the Pullman and took
their seats in the smoking compartment.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was still quite dark, but a faint band of gray
over the hills to the east told that the dawn was not
far distant. The train rolled out of the yards,
through the deserted streets, along the embankment
by the dark river, past the twin bridges spanning
canal and highway at the city limits, up the long
grade that led to the slate cut, through the cut,
over the bridge spanning the deep ravine beyond,
and so on toward Cincinnati. For some time,
neither Allan nor Mr. Schofield spoke, but sat silently
staring out of the window, for every foot
of the way had some association for them. It was
that embankment which they had laboured so hard
to save in time of flood, when the mighty current
of the river was slowly seeping over it; it was in
that cut that Allan had encountered Reddy Magraw,
half crazed, one wild night; it was from the
bridge beyond that a gang of wreckers had attempted
to hurl the pay-car. How familiar it all
was—how near, and yet how far-away, those days
seemed!</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, as the dawn lightened, a tousle-headed man
came in, coat, collar and shoes in hand, and made
a hasty toilet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Couldn’t sleep a wink last night,” he said, when
he had got his hands and face washed, his collar
on and his tie tied. “This road certainly has got
’em all beat for curves.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It <i>does</i> wind a little as it comes through the
mountains,” agreed Mr. Schofield, smiling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wind!” exclaimed the stranger. “It corkscrews!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You see, it has to follow the streams,” explained
the superintendent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, the streams must ’a’ been drunk when
they struck out their path, then. Well, well,” he
added, glancing through the window at the frost-whitened
fields, “that’s the first time I’ve seen any
frost for two years.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where’ve you been?” inquired Mr. Schofield.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Down at Panama. I run an engine on the
Isthmus railroad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you?” and Mr. Schofield looked at him
with interest. “How are things getting along down
there?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The dirt is certainly flying some. But it’s an
almighty big job we’ve tackled.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, by the way,” Mr. Schofield added, “there
used to be a brakeman on this road named Guy
Kirk, who went to Panama about a year and a half
ago. Did you ever hear of him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hear of him? I guess I did. He’s a conductor,
now, freight, and everybody thinks a whole
lot of him. And he gets around mighty lively considerin’
what he went through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Went through? How do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, sir,” said the stranger, getting out a
darkly-coloured brier and filling it from a red-leather
pouch, “it was this way. There’s a mighty
mean grade going down into Ancon—mighty
mean. It’s steep and it’s got a sharp curve at the
bottom. It’s pretty ticklish getting down sometimes,
especially when the rails are slippery and
the road-bed squashy after one of them heavy tropical
rains. One night a heavy freight, on which
Kirk was front brakeman, started down that grade.
The engineer threw on his air, but there wasn’t any,
and the first thing he knowed they were scootin’
down that grade at forty miles an hour. The engineer
whistled five or six times to warn the crew
in the caboose and then he and his fireman jumped.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what did Kirk do?” asked Mr. Schofield,
deeply interested.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, sir,” answered the narrator, slowly exhaling
a long puff, “Kirk didn’t jump. Instead
o’ that, he hustled out on that train an’ began to
set the hand-brakes. The first eight or ten cars
were full of nut coal. Kirk only got about two
brakes set, when the train hit the curve. The rails
spread, o’ course; Kirk hit the ground first an’ the
ten cars o’ nut coal piled up on top of him. Nobody
ever expected to see him alive again, but when
they dug the coal off, blamed if there he didn’t set
in a kind o’ little hut the cars had made over him
as they fell. Only both his legs was caught below
the knee an’ broke so bad that they never did get
quite straight again. But it wasn’t long after that
he got his promotion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Other occupants of the sleeper had come in while
the story was in progress, and a few minutes later
came the first call to breakfast. Allan, at least,
was ready for it, and he and Mr. Schofield lost no
time in seeking the diner.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps no other one improvement in railway
service has added as much to the comfort and convenience
of the travelling public as has this, which
enables the passengers on any first-class train to
eat their meals at leisure, when they want them,
and to procure well-cooked and appetizing food,
temptingly served amid pleasant surroundings. It
is not so many years since the passenger was dependent
for his food either on such supplies as he
had brought with him, or upon hasty lunches in
dirty depot dining-rooms, where the cold and unpleasant
food was bolted in fear and trembling lest
the train puffing outside pull away. Not that the
proprietors of the dining-rooms themselves were
wholly to blame for this condition, for they never
knew how many customers they were going to
have, trains were often late, fifteen or twenty minutes
was the utmost time allowed for a meal by
the management of any road, and not more than
half of that was available for actual eating, while
to keep free from soot and smoke and cinders a
dining-room in a depot building was a task beyond
human ingenuity.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the meal, Mr. Schofield led the way to the
rear of the diner, where, from the platform, they
could watch the track spinning backwards from
under them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Notice the absence of dust,” he said, and, indeed,
as the train swept onward, there was practically
no dust behind it. “We’ve accomplished
that by washing the gravel before we use it as ballast,
instead of dumping it in just as it comes from
the gravel-pit, as we used to do. It only costs about
half a cent a yard to wash it, and it makes it as
clean as crushed stone.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It certainly makes it a lot cleaner back here,”
remarked the man in charge of the dining-car.
“We can keep the back door open now. The only
time we have to shut it,” he added, suiting the
action to the word, “is when we pass the stock-yards.
Nobody can enjoy a meal with that scent
blowing in upon them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The stock-yards consisted of long rows of flimsy
frame buildings, lining either side of the tracks for
perhaps half a mile just outside of Cincinnati.
Here the thousands and thousands of steers, hogs,
and sheep shipped in from the west were loaded
and unloaded. Narrow runways led from the pens
up to the level of the freight-car doors, and up and
down these, incoming or outgoing stock was constantly
ascending or descending, urged by prods in
the hands of the stock-yard men. It was not a
pleasant sight, and our two friends contemplated
it silently as the train sped past.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Man has a good deal to answer for in this
world,” remarked Mr. Schofield, “and I sometimes
think he’ll be called to account pretty severely
for the suffering of those poor steers. They are
bred out on the prairies, you know, are left absolutely
shelterless in winter and freeze or starve to
death by thousands. Those that manage to survive,
are crowded into the stock-cars and shipped east.
There’s a law requiring that they be fed and watered
every so often, and that they be taken out of
the cars after so long a time. But there’s nobody
to enforce the law, and it’s pretty generally disregarded.
It’s always been a wonder to me that the
stock reaches the eastern markets at all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What can be done about it?” asked Allan, soberly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The railroads can’t do anything. But the government
could compel all stockmen to furnish adequate
shelter and food for their stock in winter,
and the torture of this long-distance shipping could
be avoided if the big slaughter-houses were out in
the stock-raising district, so that only the meat need
be shipped. Do you remember,” he added, after a
moment, “in Bellamy’s ‘Looking Backward,’ how
incomprehensible and repulsive the thought of flesh-eating
had become? Well, I believe Bellamy was
right. Already there is a rapidly growing feeling
against meat-eating, and the day is not so very
far distant when it will be practically abolished.
And a good thing, too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The train had run under the great train-shed, as
they were talking, and five minutes later, Mr. Schofield
and Allan were shown into the office of General
Manager Round. It was a plainly-furnished,
business-like room, typical of the man who occupied
it—a man who had risen from the ranks and
who had endeared himself to every man under him
by justice, kindness and square-dealing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How are you, boys?” he said, shaking hands
with both of them heartily. “Glad to see you. Sit
down. Now, Ed, what’s this I hear about a
strike?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Mr. Schofield, “it looks a good
deal like we were going to have one.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s have the story,” said Mr. Round, settling
back in his chair, and he listened with half-closed
eyes while Mr. Schofield told the story of the
trouble with Bassett and the interview with Nixon.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you really think there’ll be a strike?” he
asked, when Mr. Schofield had finished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course Nixon may have been bluffing,”
answered the latter slowly, “but I don’t believe it.
I think there’ll be a strike, unless—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unless what?” asked Mr. Round, as the superintendent
paused.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we can reinstate Bassett.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, we can’t,” said Mr. Round. “We can’t
reinstate Bassett and preserve any discipline on this
division. So count that out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I agree with you, of course,” said Mr. Schofield.
“There’s a second course open.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We can bribe Nixon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You think he’s bribable?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know he is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what’s his price?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know that exactly. But I should say
about a thousand dollars. Of course, a general
strike would cost us a great deal more than that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Round nodded. Then he happened to glance
at Allan West’s burning face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you think about it, Allan?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wouldn’t bribe a man if it kept the road from
being tied up for a year,” answered Allan, impetuously.
“Besides, you’re not really helping matters—the
thing will have to be fought out sooner
or later. Let’s fight it out now. We’ll get out
trains through in spite of them. We’ll have the law
back of us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The law isn’t much of a protection,” remarked
Mr. Round. “It doesn’t so much prevent crime,
as punish it. And it isn’t much of a compensation
to a railroad, after it has had two or three hundred
thousand dollars’ worth of property destroyed, to
have the fellows who did it sent to jail. Besides,
what’s the use of being so horror-stricken at the
idea of bribery? We’re always giving or taking
bribes. When you tipped the waiter in the diner
this morning, you bribed him to give you better
service than he gave the other people he was serving.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I didn’t tip him,” said Allan, smiling, “and
that was just the reason. I agree with you that
tipping is petty bribery, and diminishes the self-respect
of both the giver and receiver.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’ve hit it,” approved Mr. Round. “To
give a bribe diminishes one’s self-respect. But has
a corporation like a railroad any self-respect?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It ought to have.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Most people seem to think it hasn’t even common
honesty, because it has had to fight with such
weapons as came to hand. Good Lord! does anybody
suppose the railroads <i>wanted</i> to give passes
and contribute to campaign funds, and maintain
a lobby, and pay bribes? But they couldn’t get
what they wanted any other way!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan smiled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sometimes they wanted things they hadn’t any
business with,” he said, “and they’re suffering for
it now. But I guess they’ll pull through. The
public will see after a while that they’re not so black
as they’re painted. And right here’s a chance to
keep this one clean.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again Mr. Round nodded. Then he wheeled his
chair around and for some moments sat staring
thoughtfully out of the window. Then he wheeled
sharply back.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Schofield,” he said, “you tell Nixon to go
ahead and call a strike, if he wants to.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>A<span class='sc'>llan</span> was on his feet, his eyes shining.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s great!” he said. “That’s great.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Round motioned him to sit down again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It isn’t altogether on high moral grounds I’m
deciding this way,” he said. “It’s because I don’t
think a strike, starting from such a fool cause, will
hurt us. I think it will help us. We need public
sympathy and public confidence. The public has
been weaned away from us by a lot of muck-rakers.
Here’s a chance to get it back. And now, Ed,”
he added, “you’ve got to make a grand-stand play.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” agreed Mr. Schofield. “What is
it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’ve got to bribe Nixon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bribe Nixon?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And show him up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A light broke over Mr. Schofield’s face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!” he said. “I see.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You and I will talk it over,” said Mr. Round.
“But it’s lunch time,” he added, looking at his
watch. “Of course you’re coming with me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So the three went out to lunch together, and for
a time forgot the cares of railroading. Only once
was the road referred to.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got to see Mr. Heywood before I go back,”
Mr. Schofield remarked. “There’s one or two little
matters I want to take up with him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Round’s face darkened.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You won’t see him to-day,” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why not?” questioned Mr. Schofield.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The fact of the matter is,” said Mr. Round,
after a moment’s hesitation, “Heywood hasn’t been
at his office for three days.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hum!” said Mr. Schofield, his face darkening
too. “Has it got that bad? I’d heard stories, of
course, but I’d hoped they were exaggerated.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s been getting worse and worse, and I don’t
believe he’ll hold his job much longer. He may be
let down easy, because he’s been a good man—and
he’d be a good man yet if he could let drink
alone. But it’s getting more and more hold on him
all the time. He knows it and is ashamed of it,
but he don’t seem to have strength enough to break
away from it. It’s too bad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, it is,” agreed Mr. Schofield. “What I
hate about it most is the humiliation his daughter
must suffer. I don’t know whether you knew her
or not—Betty Heywood—but she was a mighty
nice girl.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I didn’t know her,” said Mr. Round.
“But she seems to have saved herself. I heard
the other day that she was going to get married.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan’s heart bounded suddenly, and his face reddened,
but neither of his companions noticed his
agitation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s a good thing,” said Mr. Schofield.
“Who’s the man?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t remember his name,” answered Mr.
Round. “I heard some of the boys talking about
it the other day—of course there may be nothing
in it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I hope it’s so,” remarked the other. “It
would solve a mighty unpleasant situation. Now,
I’m going to turn you loose for the afternoon,
Allan,” he added. “Meet me in time to catch
Number Two and we’ll have dinner together on the
diner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well, sir,” said Allan, welcoming the opportunity
to be alone with his thoughts. “I’ll be
there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He walked slowly up the street, seeing nothing
of the busy life about him, turning over and over
in his mind the bit of gossip which Mr. Round had
repeated. Could it be true, he wondered. Suppose
it were, what would it mean to him? It had been
years since he had seen Betty Heywood; it was
very probable that the girl whose image lived in
his heart was very different from the reality. At
any rate, it was absurd to suppose that she would
have anything more than the faintest of remembrances
of the boy she had befriended in years gone
by.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shaking such thoughts away, at last, he considered
for a moment where he should spend the afternoon.
He decided in favour of the Art Museum,
and boarding a car, started on the long, beautiful
ride to Eden Park. The route carried him up one
of the long inclines, which are a unique feature of
Cincinnati’s street railway system. The city proper
is built in the valley along the river, and is surrounded
by hills two or three hundred feet in
height, where the most exclusive residence sections
are. These are reached by inclines, where the cars
are hoisted and lowered by means of massive wire
cables.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the car rose slowly up the incline, Cincinnati
lay spread below him, a charming city, marred only
by the haze of coal smoke which a too-indulgent
city government made little effort to suppress.
Half an hour later, he was at his destination and
entered the museum, whose collection of paintings,
statuary and other works of art is one of the most
famous in the middle west. He spent a most enjoyable
hour wandering from room to room, and
was about ready to go, when, in one of the far
galleries, he noticed a woman at work before an
easel, and, strolling nearer, saw that she was making
a copy of one of the larger paintings. He
was about to turn away, fearing that he was intruding,
when she glanced up and saw him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, Allan West,” she cried, and started up,
hand outstretched, and he saw that it was Betty</p>

<p class='c013'>Heywood. “It <i>is</i> Allan West, isn’t it?” she asked,
as he stood for an instant chained to the spot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It certainly is,” he answered, clasping the welcoming
hand. “But I didn’t expect to see you
here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nor I to see you,” she broke in. “What has
a train dispatcher to do with picture galleries?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mighty little, I’m sorry to say. I didn’t know
you were an artist!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m not,” she said, laughing merrily. “I’m
only a copyist. What do you think of it?” she
added, with a gesture toward the picture on the
easel.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan gazed at it with unfeigned admiration,
though to a more critical eye, its shortcomings
would have been evident enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s fine,” he said. “It’s splendid! Where did
you learn how?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again she laughed, though her cheeks flushed a
little at his praise.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve been working at it for a long time,” she
said. “But don’t deceive yourself—it isn’t a work
of art—it’s merely a pot-boiler.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A what?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A pot-boiler—designed, in other words, not
for fame, but to furnish food and raiment. But,
come,” she added, “I’ve worked enough for one
day and I need some fresh air. Will you come
along?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I certainly will!” he said, his face lighting, and
he watched her while she stowed her paints away
in a box, giving them, together with the easel and
the unfinished painting, into the care of one of the
attendants.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now wait till I get my hat and coat,” she said,
“and off we go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She was back in a few moments, her piquant
face set off by a most becoming toque, and her
painting apron replaced by a long wrap.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” she said, and a moment later they
were walking down the steps together.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not till then did he have an opportunity to look
at her, and he was struck with a sudden sense of
strangeness. This was not the Betty Heywood he
had known, but a woman brighter, more dashing,
more self-assured. He was surprised, in a way,
to find that there was no shadow of her father’s
failure on her. He had expected to find her labouring
with that sorrow, or at least showing visible
traces of it, and he wondered how she had escaped
so completely.</p>

<p class='c013'>She glanced at him once or twice, as they turned
together along one of the paths of the park, and
opened her lips to speak, but closed them again,
as though hesitating how to begin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re still at Wadsworth?” she asked, at
last.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the dispatchers’ office?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Chief dispatcher now,” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you?” she said. “Isn’t that fine! But I
knew you’d work your way right up. Do you
know, you’ve developed into just the sort of man
that you were a boy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Doesn’t everybody?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no indeed. Very few people do. Most of
us grow crooked—there’s always something in
the path that throws us out of line. Sometimes it
throws us up and sometimes it throws us down,
but you’ve grown right straight ahead. Now I
can tell by the way you look at me that I’m not
at all the kind of woman you expected I would be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was a little disconcerted at this frankness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” he said, at last, “you’re right there. I
can’t quite make you out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve had obstacles, you see,” she said, her face
clouding for an instant. “I’ve grown crooked.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I heard of your mother’s death,” he said, gently.
“I shall never forget her, though I met her
only once.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—dear mother. She thought a great deal
of you. So did father.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your father was very kind to me,” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>She looked quickly into his face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Things have not been well with us,” she said,
with a little catch in her voice. “I had to go to
work. I found I had some little artistic talent, and
I turned it to account. And I’ve made a lot of good
friends here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She looked at him again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’ve heard that I’m going to be married?”
she asked, suddenly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” he answered, as evenly as he could.
“Mr. Round said something about it to-day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s going to be next month. His name’s
Knowlton—Robert Underwood Knowlton—he’s
a lawyer, and the dearest fellow that ever was. I
wish you could meet him. I know you’d like him,”
she went on, rapidly. Then she stopped suddenly
and looked at him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Allan,” she said, her hand on his
arm. “Don’t look like that. It’s not I you’re in
love with—you’re not in love with anybody. You
never have been with me. You happened to meet
me when you were lonely, and you gave me a little
niche in your heart. But you don’t love me—that’s
not what love is. I’m not at all the kind of
woman you imagined—you’ve seen that already.
Now you mustn’t be foolish—shake hands, like a
brother.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He looked down into her face, and suddenly it
seemed as though a veil were swept away, and he
saw that she was right. It wasn’t love he felt for
her—it was only affection. Her eyes, watching
him anxiously, brightened as she saw the change
in his face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re the dearest girl that ever was,” he said,
clasping her hand, “and the bravest. I’m not sure
that I’m not falling in love with you now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, you’re not!” she cried, patting him on the
arm. “I knew I was right!” she added, her face
beaming. “You’ve made me so happy—for I
couldn’t help worrying a little, sometimes. Will
you come to the wedding, if I ask you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ask me and see,” he retorted, laughing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Elizabeth Heywood requests the favour
of Mr. Allan West’s attendance at her wedding,
February 16th, at two o’clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> R. S. V. P.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Allan West acknowledges the receipt of
Miss Heywood’s kind invitation and accepts with
pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good!” she cried, clapping her hands. “Then
you’ll meet Bob and you’ll see what a lucky girl
I am.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think I’ll be more apt to see what a lucky
fellow he is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we’re both lucky, and we’re going to be
very, very happy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope you will,” he said, heartily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you, Allan; I know you do. And now
here comes my car. Stop it for me. Good-bye,”
she added, as the car came to a stop opposite them.
“And I can’t tell you how glad I am I met you
this afternoon. Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c013'>She waved her hand to him from the platform,
and was gone.</p>

<p class='c013'>He stood for a moment, watching the car, then
turned slowly back toward the museum. He, also,
was glad that he had met Betty Heywood—glad
that she had been brave enough and clear-sighted
enough to set him right with her and with the
world.</p>

<p class='c013'>And yet he realized dimly that there was suddenly
a place vacant in his heart.</p>

<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c006'>CHAPTER X <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>IN THE SWITCH TOWER</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>W<span class='sc'>ithout</span> pausing at the museum, Allan boarded
a car back to the city. After all, he reflected, Betty
Heywood was right—train-dispatching had little
to do with art and artists. He realized that he had
looked at the paintings and the statuary from the
outside, as it were; he had been interested in them,
it is true, as he would have been interested in a play
or a novel. They had entertained him, they had
helped him to pass a pleasant hour, and that was
all. He did not feel that they were vital to him—vital
in the sense that a thorough knowledge of
railroading was.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a word, he was narrowing into a specialist, as
every man who really accomplishes anything in the
world must do. His work had become the only
really necessary and vital thing to him. He had
found his groove, and while he still possessed the
power to climb out of his groove occasionally and
to look about the world and find amusement in it,
it was in his groove that he felt most at home, that
he was strongest and most efficient and most contented.</p>

<p class='c013'>For his efficiency—the knowledge that he
was really doing something in the world—rejoiced
him and moved him to stronger effort.</p>

<p class='c013'>So his feet naturally led him back to the great
depot which formed the Union terminal for all the
lines of railroad entering Cincinnati. It was a place
which might well be interesting to any one, so
crowded was it with life and well-directed skill. To
any one looking at it understandingly it was more
than interesting. It was engrossing. Nowhere else
did the life-blood of traffic pulse quite so strongly;
nowhere else was there quite such an opportunity
to study human nature; and nowhere else was
perfection of organization in railroading so necessary
and so evident.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was this latter point which interested Allan
most of all, and so, with merely a fleeting glance
at the crowds hurrying past him, he bent his steps
along one of the narrow cement platforms which
ran out under the train-shed like long, gray fingers.
In the midst of the tangle of tracks just beyond
the train-shed, stood a tall, box-like structure, its
upper story entirely enclosed in glass. Dodging
an outgoing train, Allan hastened toward this queer
tower, climbed the narrow stair which led to its
upper story, opened the door and looked in.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hello, Jim,” he said, to a man in shirt-sleeves
who stood looking down upon the busy yards.
“May I come in?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The man turned quickly and held out his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, Mr. West,” he said. “Come in and sit
down,” and he motioned toward a chair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then a bell overhead rang sharply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the Pennsylvania limited,” he said.
“Give her track number twelve, Sam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There were two other shirt-sleeved men in the
little room, standing before a long board from
which projected what appeared to be a series of
little handles like those one sees on water-cocks.
At the words, one of the men turned one of these
little handles.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again the bell rang.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Number seventeen for the accommodation,”
said the man Allan had addressed as Jim, and another
little handle was turned, while still a third,
which had been turned, sprang back to its original
position.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There goes that school-teachers’ special from
eleven,” added Jim. “Fix her, Nick,” and the
third man turned a handle at his end of the board.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan, meanwhile, had taken a seat, and gazed
down over the network of tracks. Trains were
arriving and departing almost every minute. Busy
little yard-engines were hustling strings of coaches
about, pulling them out from under the great
train-shed or backing them up into it. Down the
long cement walks beneath the shed, arriving and
departing passengers were hurrying to and fro;
trucks piled high with luggage or groaning under
a load of mail-sacks or express matter were being
propelled back and forth with almost superhuman
skill; engineers were “oiling round,” blue-coated
conductors were reading their orders, hostlers with
flaring torches were taking a last look at wheels
and connections—in a word, the busy life of a
great terminal was at full blast.</p>

<p class='c013'>And above it all, controlling it, as it were, by
a movement of a finger, stood Jim—James Anderson
Davis, if you care for his full name—gazing
down upon it nonchalantly, and giving a
terse order now and then. For Jim is the chief
towerman, than whom, in his sphere, no autocrat
is more autocratic and no czar more absolute.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>It is a fearful and wonderful thing, this controlling
the trains that arrive at and depart from
a great terminal—almost too fearful and wonderful
to be put upon paper. But at least we will make
the effort.</p>

<p class='c013'>Most modern terminals resemble each other in
general plan. Railroads have found it not only
convenient for the public but economical for themselves
to build “union stations” in the larger
cities, wherever possible. That is, a suitable site
is selected, as near the business centre of the city
as it is possible to get, and the roads join together
in providing the money necessary to purchase it and
erect the station building, the cost being pro-rated
in proportion to the amount of traffic which each
road gets from the station.</p>

<div id='p104'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/p104.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>“CONTROLLING IT, AS IT WERE, BY A MOVEMENT OF FINGER, STOOD JIM.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The side fronting upon the street is usually handsomely
embellished, for it is this side which the
public sees as it approaches, and all railroads know
that to make a good impression is to do good advertising.
So with the main waiting-room, which
always lies directly behind the street doors. Here
marble, mosaic and gilding are always in evidence
and no opportunity is lost to impress the travelling
public with the wealth and magnificence of the road
which it is using. On either side of the main waiting-room
are smaller waiting- and retiring-rooms,
there is a row of ticket-booths, a news-stand, telephone
booths, baggage-rooms, a dining- and lunch-room
and, of course, inevitably, the long rows of
seats, back to back, where the waiting public spends
so many weary minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the stories overhead are the executive offices
of the various roads—as many of them as there
is room for—but to these the general public
seldom penetrates.</p>

<p class='c013'>Beyond the swinging doors along the side of the
waiting-room opposite the entrance is the main
platform or concourse, and from it, stretching down
between the tracks like long fingers, are the narrow
cement platforms upon which the passengers alight
or from which they mount to their trains. The
tracks are laid in pairs, and a platform extends
between every pair, each platform thus serving two
tracks, one on either side. Overhead is the great
echoing vault of the train-shed with its mighty ribs
of steel, stretching in one enormous arc across the
tracks beneath—a marvel of engineering skill, if
not of architectural beauty.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is what is known as the head-house plan,
and is the ideal one for the passenger, since it permits
him to go to and from his train without crossing
any tracks or climbing to any overhead bridges.
It is, however, expensive for the railroads since,
of course, all through trains must be backed out
and switched around until they are headed on their
way again—a process which requires no little expenditure
of time and energy, as well as money.
However, in a great city, a right of way which
would enable the through trains to continue straight
onward toward their destination is frequently so
expensive that it is cheaper to back them out the
way they came in, and send them by a detour
around the city.</p>

<p class='c013'>And upon no one is this backing-out process more
wearing than on the towerman, for the trains must
be handled twice over the same track, and of course
the track must be kept clear until the train is out
again and safely on its way. Now there is never
any surplusage of tracks in a terminal. Indeed, as
one sees the tracks narrow and narrow as the terminal
is approached, until they are merged into
those which plunge beneath the train-shed, one is
apt to think they are all too few. Yet their number
has been calculated with the greatest care; there
is not one more than is needed by the nicest economy
of operation—nor one less. The number is
just right for the station’s needs—so long as the
towerman knows his business and keeps his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>And now to return to the glass-enclosed perch
where, for eight hours of every day, Jim Davis and
his two assistants send the trains in and out over
the network of tracks. That long row of little
handles is the last word in switch-control. Time
was—and is, in all but the most important stations—when
the towerman opened or closed the yard-switches
by means of great levers. To throw one
of these levers was no small athletic feat, especially
if the switch it controlled was at some distance, and
to keep at it eight hours at a time reduced the
strongest man to mental and physical exhaustion.
When the towerman left his work at the end of his
trick, he was, in the expressive parlance of the day,
“all in.” Now when men are “all in,” they are
very apt to make mistakes, hence in a busy terminal
under the old system, accidents more or less serious
were of almost every-day occurrence. Besides
which, the number of levers which one man was
physically able to operate was comparatively small,
so that there must be many men and a consequent
divided responsibility and opportunity for confusion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tower itself had been an evolution, for, at
first, these yard-switches had been controlled by a
brigade of switchmen, each of whom had two or
three under his supervision, which he turned by
hand whenever he saw a train coming his way.
Then the hand switchmen were supplanted by a
cluster of levers in a tower, operated by a single
man. The tower was so located that its occupant
had a general view of the yards, and the levers
were connected by steel rods with the switches and
signals which protected them. For every switch
must have its signal—that is, a device by which
the engineer of the approaching train may see
whether the switch is properly set—the old standards
showing yellow when the switch was open and
red when it was closed—and since replaced by
arms, or semaphores, which hang down when the
train may pass and bar the way when it must stop.</p>

<p class='c013'>This grouping of the levers in the tower simplified
the control of the yard and placed the responsibility
upon a more intelligent and more highly
paid man than the average switchman, and consequently
broadened the margin of safety. But terminals
grew and yards grew and switches increased
in number, until even this system was unable to
meet the demands made upon it.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was at a time when this state of affairs seemed
seriously to threaten the safety of operation of
great terminals that some genius invented the pneumatic
control. Instead of a row of great levers requiring
the strongest muscles, the towerman found
himself confronting a battery of tiny ones, operated
by the touch of a finger. And that finger-touch
against the slender lever is instantly magnified
to the pull of a giant arm against a switch half
a mile or more away.</p>

<p class='c013'>How? By a bewildering intricacy of cogs and
valves, by the aid of the electric current and of
compressed air, for, in order to perfect this mechanism,
man has harnessed the whirlwind and the
lightning. That finger-touch brings instantly an
electric touch; the electric touch raises a valve
which releases the compressed air from a cylinder
into which it has been pumped; and the air thus
withdrawn from the cylinder in the tower basement
is also in the same instant withdrawn from a cylinder
opposite the switch-point, by means of a slender
pipe which connects the two; and a plunger in the
cylinder at the switch moves the switch-point and
the signals which protect it.</p>

<p class='c013'>That seems enough for any mere machine to do—but
it does much more. For, by a series of interlocking
devices, the switches are so controlled
by each other that no signal for a train to proceed
can be given until all the other switches over which
the train will pass have been properly set and
locked, nor can any switch be moved as long as
any signal is displayed which gives right of way
over it. Thus was the margin of safety further
broadened, and the control of a great terminal
brought down to three men on each eight hour
trick, representing the very cream of their profession.</p>

<p class='c013'>Approaching trains announce their coming by
ringing an electric gong, the chief towerman, of
course, knowing just which train is due at that
particular instant—knowing, too, if any train is
late, and how late and with what other trains it
conflicts. He must know the precise second of departure
of each train from the shed, and every
train must glide smoothly in and out without let
or hindrance. He must <i>know</i>; he mustn’t merely
think he knows, for this is one of the positions in
which a man never has a chance to make two mistakes.
For, while the tower machinery is wonderfully
adapted to its purpose, it is, after all, the mind
of the chief towerman which controls and directs it.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>It was not by any means the first time that Allan
West had sat watching this fascinating scene, but
it had never grown uninteresting and he had never
ceased to wonder at it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I used to think train-dispatching was a pretty
nerve-racking business,” he remarked, after a while,
“but it’s child’s play compared with this.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I don’t know,” said Jim, his eyes on a
through train threading its way cautiously out of
the terminal and over the network of switches.
“We don’t have to worry about big accidents up
here—the interlocking takes care of that. We
can’t have a head-end collision, for instance—at
least, not while the signals are working properly.
What we’ve got to look out for is tangles. If we
have to hold one train two or three minutes, that
means that two or three other trains will be held
up, and before you know it, you’ve got a block ten
miles long. Then’s when somebody up here has to
do some tall thinking and do it quick. The only
way to keep things straight is to keep ’em moving.
Sixteen,” he added to his assistants, as the overhead
bell rang.</p>

<p class='c013'>They watched the train as it rolled in, saw it
disgorge its load of passengers, saw the baggage
and express and mail matter hustled off, saw the
yard-engine back up and couple on to the rear coach,
and slowly drag the train out from under the train-shed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I never watch that done,” added Jim, as the
train disappeared down the yards, “but what my
heart gets right up in my throat. You don’t know
what a way those pesky little yard-engines have of
jumping switches. Open sixteen, Sam,” he added,
as the big engine which had brought the train in
rolled sedately down the yards on the way to the
round-house, to be washed out and raked down and
coaled up. “Ring off thirteen, Nick,” he said, and
Nick touches one of the little handles, a blade on
a signal bridge opposite the end of the train-shed
drops, there is a sharp puff, puff, of a locomotive,
and another train starts slowly from the train-shed
on its journey east or west, north or south, as the
case may be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile, the little switch-engine has set its
train of coaches in upon one of the innumerable
sidings away down the yards where passenger cars
are stored—and one would scarcely believe how
many miles of such storage track every great terminal
requires—has uncoupled and started back
toward the train-shed for another load—her
movements, by the way, as well-known to and
thoroughly understood by the chief towerman as
are those of the most glittering through train. Already
the train of coaches is in the hands of the
cleaners and stockers, for it will start out again
presently upon another trip. Modern passenger
cars represent too much money to be allowed to
repose on a siding a minute longer than necessary.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cleaners swarm into the coaches, dusty and
dirty and foul after the long journey, dragging behind
them long lines of hose. The hose carries
compressed air, and in half an hour those cars are
sucked clean of dirt and are as fresh and sweet as
when they first came from the shops. Other cleaners
are washing the windows and polishing the
metal fittings. Trucks pull up loaded with ice, with
clean linen, and the stockers see that every car is
supplied. Farther along is the diner, and to it come
the butcher’s cart, the baker’s cart, the grocer’s cart;
dozens and dozens of napkins and table-cloths are
taken aboard, and already the chef is making out
the menu for the dinner which will be served in an
hour or two somewhere out on the road. It is all
wonderful—fearful and wonderful, when one
stops to think of it—impossible to set on paper
except in broad suggestive splashes, as an impressionist
paints a sunset.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>“Are you going back on Two?” asked Jim.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Allan, glancing at the tower clock.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, there she comes,” said Jim, and motioned
toward a cut of coaches being backed into the train-shed
by one of the ever-present switch-engines.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” said Allan. “I’ll go down and
hunt up Mr. Schofield. He’s going back with me.
This is a great place, Jim.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come again,” said Jim heartily. “You’re
always welcome. He’s a fine young fellow,” he
continued, as Allan went down the stairs. “He’ll
have his office up yonder one of these days,” and
he motioned toward the towering stories of the terminal
building. “Number eight, Sam,” he added,
as the bell rang. “There comes the St. Louis express.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch11' class='c006'>CHAPTER XI <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>ALLAN’S EYES ARE OPENED</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>T<span class='sc'>he</span> return trip to Wadsworth was accomplished
without incident, and, bidding Mr. Schofield good-bye,
Allan ran up to his office to assure himself that
everything was all right, and then, after writing
a necessary order or two, turned his steps homeward.
The night was still and clear and it seemed
to him that his steps rang on the pavement more
loudly than usual. Certainly, as they turned in at
the gate, they must have been heard within the
Welsh home, for a moment later, the front door
was opened and Mamie stood there, light in hand,
to welcome him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan looked at her smiling down at him, with
a strange little stirring of the heart. She had
grown up almost without his noticing it; he had
been so absorbed in his work that he had not seen
the change from girlhood into young maidenhood.
He knew, of course, that she had progressed
through the graded schools and at last, triumphantly,
through the High school; he knew, when
he stopped to think of it, that she would soon be
seventeen; but she had continued, to all intents
and purposes, the child he had snatched from death
in the first days of their meeting. Now, somehow,
all that was changed, and he gazed up into her face,
seeing clearly, for the first time, what a winsome
face it was.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So you’re back!” she cried, standing aside that
he might enter. “But I heard Number Two
whistle in half an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Allan. “I had a little work to do
before I could come home. Do you know, Mamie,”
he added, pausing beside her in the little hall, and
looking down at her, “I’d never noticed before
what a pretty young woman you’ve been growing
into.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The colour in Mamie’s cheeks deepened a little,
but the blue eyes lifted to his did not waver, nor
was there a trace of self-consciousness in her laugh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look at these freckles,” she cried, her finger on
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Beauty spots!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And this pug nose.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A love of a nose!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And this big mouth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I should like to kiss it,” he said, and then
stopped with a sudden burning consciousness that
the words should not have been uttered. “Forgive
me, Mamie,” he said, quickly. “I didn’t mean
that—or, rather, I did mean it, but I shouldn’t
have said it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why shouldn’t you have said it?” she inquired,
seriously, looking up at him with a little
pucker of perplexity in her forehead. “Why
shouldn’t you kiss me, if you like?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He trembled a little before this trusting innocence,
and searched around in his mind somewhat
miserably for a reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t quite know,” he answered, at last. “I’ll
think it over. But you’ll freeze to death here, with
no wrap on,” and without looking at her, he led
the way into the sitting room beyond.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mamie followed him, and, placing the lamp upon
a table, sat down thoughtfully before the fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So you’re back, Allan?” said Jack, laying
aside the local evening paper, which he had been
reading aloud to Mary.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And hungry, too,” added Mary, hastily rolling
her knitting into a ball. “I’ll have ye a snack in
a minute, Allan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No you won’t,” retorted Allan, placing his
hands on her shoulders and holding her in her
chair as she started to rise. “I had dinner in the
diner with Mr. Schofield, and really ate more than
I should. I’m not the least hungry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And feeling Mary subside under his hands, he
released her and sat down.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the news?” he added, turning to Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, nothin’ much,” replied the latter. “I’ve
heard a good deal of talk to-day about that court
decision on the employers’ liability act. One section-man
dropped a heavy tie on another section-man—an’
the feller that was hurt sued the railroad
under the law. Now the court holds that the law
don’t apply, and some of the boys are sayin’ that
nothin’ that helps the labourin’ man ever does apply
when it gits up to the supreme court.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—I’ve heard of the case,” said Allan.
“But look here, Jack—do you think the road
ought to be made to pay, because one of its men
injures another through carelessness? It wasn’t
the road injured him. Suppose you hired two men
to build a chimney and one of them let a brick fall
on the other and killed him. Would you think you
were to blame, or that you ought to pay damages?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said Jack. “Sure not. But somehow a
case against a corporation looks different to most
people.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it does,” agreed Allan. “And there
are a lot of people who wouldn’t steal from an
individual who don’t hesitate to steal from a corporation.
It’s a queer state of public morals. But
who was doing the talking?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Jack, “most of it was done by a
big fellow with a black moustache named Nixon.
Somebody said he’d come on to make the road
take Rafe Bassett back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The disgust in his voice told how unfavourably
he considered such a proposition.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, don’t you be afraid,” said Allan, “the
road won’t take him back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m glad to hear it. I know Rafe Bassett—he’s
low down trash—he’s always got a hammer
out fer somebody. I never did understand how he
got the pull he’s got with his lodge.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, he’ll need a pull before he gets through
this,” said Allan, “but let’s talk about something
else, Jack. Oh,” he added, suddenly, “who do
you think I saw in Cincinnati to-day? I had the
afternoon to myself and I went out to the Art
Museum—and there, painting a picture, sat Betty
Heywood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A sudden wave of colour flooded Mamie’s face,
but no one saw it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Paintin’ a picture?” repeated Mrs. Welsh.
“Is she a painter?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, and a mighty good one, so far as I was
able to judge, though she laughed at me and said
she wasn’t. She seemed glad to see me and we
took a little walk together.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He paused a moment, for there was an unaccountable
difficulty, somehow, in telling what he
had to tell. Mamie’s eyes were on his face, and
she was deadly pale.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She told me about her work,” he went on.
“She said she’d had to do something for a living,
and had done well with her paintings. I should
think she would.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Had to do something for a livin’?” echoed
Mrs. Welsh. “Where’s her father?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s going down grade,” answered Allan, soberly,
and told what he had heard of Mr. Heywood’s
dissipation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m mighty sorry t’ hear that,” remarked Jack,
when Allan had finished. “Mr. Heywood was a
good man an’ a square man. I’ve seen better superintendents—we’ve
got a better one now—but,
all the same, I liked Mr. Heywood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So did I,” said Allan. “I wish something
could be done.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When drink gits its grip on a man as old as
him,” he said, “they ain’t much hope.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank goodness his wife’s dead,” added Mrs.
Welsh. “It’s the wife that it’s allers the hardest on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s hard enough on the daughter,” broke in
Mamie, softly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, she won’t have to stand it much longer,”
said Allan, seizing the opening Mamie’s remark
gave him. “She’s going to be married next
month.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mamie gave a quick gasp, which she tried to
change into a cough, and bent again toward the
fire, hiding her throbbing face in her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mary was staring at Allan, as though scarcely
able to believe her ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Married?” she repeated. “Who to? Allan,
do you mean—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’s going to marry a young lawyer named
Knowlton,” broke in Allan, evenly. “It’s to be on
the sixteenth, and she asked me to come.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mary bent again to her knitting, with a sort of
hiss that sounded suspiciously like “the hussy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She seems to be very happy over it,” Allan went
on, anxious that these dear friends should understand,
and yet fearing to say too much. “She’s a
splendid girl, and beautiful as ever; but she’s
changed, too. She’s not the same girl I used to
know.” Mamie was looking at him now, with
intense eyes. So was Mrs. Welsh. “She saw it
in my face, somehow, and we laughed over it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Jack, heavily, “I used t’ think you
was kind o’ sweet on her yerself, Allan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thought so, too,” answered Allan, smiling.
“But I guess it was just girls in general—you
know she was about the only one I ever met. I’m
mighty glad she’s going to be happy. I’m going
to the wedding. Why, where’s Mamie?” he added,
looking around at the sound of a softly closed door.
“She not going to bed already?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Already!” echoed Mrs. Welsh. “Do you
know it’s after eleven o’clock? Time everyone of
us was a-bed. Come, now, off wid ye!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan laughed and arose, stretching himself
lazily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hadn’t any idea it was so late,” he said.
“Good-night,” and he mounted to his room.</p>

<p class='c013'>He went immediately to bed—but not to sleep.
The events of the day had been many and interesting.
He closed his eyes, and called up again
the minutes he had passed with Betty Heywood—he
heard her voice, he saw her face—but somehow
another face kept slipping in between—a face
with a freckled, tip-tilted nose, and tender, sympathetic
mouth. Something within him seemed to
warm and gladden, and he dropped off to sleep, at
last, with a smile upon his lips.</p>

  <h2 id='ch12' class='c006'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>THE INTERVIEW WITH NIXON</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>S<span class='sc'>uperintendent</span> S<span class='sc'>chofield</span> was at his desk
bright and early next morning, for the purpose of
getting out of the way the thirty-six hours’ accumulation
of routine business, before the approaching
momentous interview with Nixon. Only
one familiar with the executive offices of a railroad
has any idea of the immense amount of correspondence,—reports,
complaints, requests for information
and instructions—which that stretch of
time can accumulate, but the superintendent waded
into the pile of letters and telegrams with a rapidity
born of long practice, and when he finally leaned
back in his chair, with a sigh of relief, it wanted
still some minutes of nine o’clock.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all, Joe,” he said, to the stenographer,
and that young man gathered up the letters, closed
his note-book, and left the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Schofield swung around in his chair and
stared down over the yards, his forehead wrinkled
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>He and Mr. Round had, the afternoon before,
gone over carefully every detail of the approaching
interview, and yet it was very possible that
some trivial incident might spoil it all. Most unpleasant
of all loomed the possibility that he had
been mistaken in his estimate of Nixon. Perhaps
the man would not take a bribe—perhaps he was
honest. Should that prove to be the case, any such
attempt as Mr. Schofield was about to undertake
could not but result most unpleasantly to himself
and to the railroad. He could already see the newspaper
headlines which would announce it—for the
press of the country had, as a rule, followed the
crowd and joined in the yelp at the heels of the
“conscienceless corporations.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>He realized that he must feel his way with the
utmost caution, and yet as he recalled Nixon’s
words, and the significant glance which accompanied
them, he could not believe that he had been
mistaken. But the man was adroit and suspicious—a
single false movement and he would be on
his guard.</p>

<p class='c013'>A tap at the door interrupted his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come in,” he called, and an instant later, the
door opened and Nixon entered the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On time, I see,” said Mr. Schofield, pleasantly,
and motioned his visitor to a chair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Nixon, taking off his luxurious
overcoat and sitting down, “I make it a point to
be on time for little conferences like this. The
boys were inclined to get mad,” he went on, “because
I gave you two days to make up your mind.
But I told them there wasn’t nothing to gain by
hurryin’ a thing like this. I told them I wanted
to give you a fair show. That’s me. I allers give
everybody a fair show.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Nixon was, at bottom, coarse and uneducated,
and this coarseness and ignorance would crop up in
his talk at times, in spite of his efforts to suppress
them. Since his promotion to a high place in the
brotherhood, he had studied incessantly how best
to make himself a “gentleman.” Unfortunately,
his conception of the meaning of that word was
modelled upon the demeanour of barbers, bar-tenders
and hotel-clerks. He believed a diamond scarf-pin
and a seal-ring to be indispensable portions
of a gentleman’s attire, together with a shirt striped
in loud colours, glazed shoes, a fancy waistcoat,
and a trace of perfume. He also believed that a
gentleman invariably wore his hat cocked over one
eye, to prove himself a knowing fellow and man
of the world. He had laboured with the utmost
diligence to form himself upon this model and was
entirely satisfied with the result. That he was not
a gentleman, and that anyone who met him would
not so consider him, never for an instant entered
his mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” he repeated, “I insisted that you be
given a fair show, and finally they saw that I was
right. I don’t believe in no snap judgments. I
heard that you was down to Cinci yesterday and
saw Round.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It may be added that another point in Nixon’s
conception of gentlemanly conduct was that he
should call men in exalted positions by their last
names to show his sense of equality, or by their
first names to prove his easy familiarity with
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Mr. Schofield, “Mr. Round and I
had a conference about the matter.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” demanded Nixon, gazing at him from
under lowered lids, “what’s the answer?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We won’t reinstate Bassett,” answered Mr.
Schofield, quietly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then, by God, it’s fight!” cried Nixon, his
face turning purple, and he brought his fist down
on the desk with a crash. “Do you realize what
all this is going to cost you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell me,” suggested Mr. Schofield. “And
don’t hit my desk again like that. Some of my men
might think there was a fight, and come in. We
don’t want any intruders.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” agreed Nixon, “we don’t,” and he
glanced sharply about the room. Then he hitched
his chair closer to the desk and leaned forward in
his earnestness. “This thing’ll cost you a hundred
thousand dollars before you’ve done with it, and no
end of trouble. I’ve been lookin’ over the field,
and I know. First, I’ll call off the engineers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll replace them,” said Mr. Schofield,
promptly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’ll try to,” corrected Nixon, “but it won’t
be so easy as you think. Good engineers ain’t knockin’
around the country lookin’ fer scab jobs—you
know that as well as I do. The good men are all
in the brotherhood. All you’ll find is a few dubs
who can run an engine after a fashion and who
don’t belong to the brotherhood or have been
kicked out—they’ll soon play hob with your engines.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No doubt they’re pretty bad if they’ve been
kicked out,” observed Mr. Schofield.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But,” continued Nixon, impressively, paying
no heed to the interruption, “the minute this scab
engineer climbs up into the cab, that same minute
the fireman will climb down. More than that, no
union conductor or brakeman will help run a train
which a scab engineer is driving, no union switchman
will throw a target for it, and no union operator
will give it orders. So there you are—fire
Bassett, and you’ll need mighty soon not only
a new outfit of engineers, but of firemen, conductors,
brakemen, switchmen and operators. Maybe
you think it’ll be easy to find new men to take their
places, but I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t either,” agreed Mr. Schofield; “but
just the same we won’t give up the fight before
it begins.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, your lines are bound to be tied up more
or less, even at the best,” said Nixon, “and right
in the busy season, too. That will mean considerable
of a loss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” nodded Mr. Schofield, “it will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And some of the loss will be permanent.
When traffic is turned aside that way, if only for
a short time, some of it always stays turned aside.
After you git things straightened out, you’ll have
to git out and hustle for business, or your earnings
will show a permanent decrease.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know that too,” said Mr. Schofield.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And there’s another thing to consider,” went
on Nixon, impressively. “Union men are orderly
and law-abiding. All they will do is to quit their
jobs and let you run the road if you can. They
won’t interfere with you—they never do.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So I have heard,” said Mr. Schofield, with a
grim smile. “Surely it’s no use repeating that
fairy tale to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s no fairy tale,” protested Nixon, earnestly,
but there was a sardonic light in his eyes. “As
I said, union men never make trouble. But there’s
always a lot of sympathizers and hangers-on who
try to help, and who always do make trouble,
however hard the union men may try to prevent
it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t think the union men will lose any sleep
trying to stop it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, they will,” contradicted Nixon, “but they
won’t be able to. Wind of this trouble has got
about, you know; and just last night, as I was
passing a saloon over here, I heard two or three
fellers talkin’ and one of them remarked what a
beautiful big blaze the stock-yards would make and
how easy it would be to start.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is this a threat?” asked Mr. Schofield, looking
fixedly at his visitor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A threat? Oh, dear, no; I’m simply telling
you what I heard—I want you to know what kind
of trouble it is you’re walkin’ into. Of course, I
stopped right away and told those fellers we union
men wouldn’t stand for nothing like that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” commented Mr. Schofield, “I’ve got a
picture of you stopping. Your righteous indignation
is plainly apparent.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, anyway,” said Nixon, grinning, “there’s
no telling what’ll happen if you decide to let this
strike go on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I didn’t say that we had decided to do that,”
said Mr. Schofield, quietly. “I only said that we
wouldn’t reinstate Bassett,” and he looked Nixon
straight in the eye.</p>

<p class='c013'>That individual sustained the gaze for a moment,
his colour deepening a little; then he arose and
made a deliberate circuit of the room, assuring
himself that all the doors were tightly closed, and
also glancing into the closet where the superintendent
hung his hat and overcoat. The inspection
finished, he returned to his chair, and produced two
big black cigars, handing one to his companion and
lighting the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thanks,” said Mr. Schofield, taking the cigar
with a little effort. He lighted it, took a puff or
two, and then looked critically at its fat, black
contour. “Good cigar,” he commented.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nixon laughed complacently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I’m kind o’ pertick’ler about my tobacco,”
he said. “These is a private stock—I get ’em
from a friend of mine. I’ll send you over a couple
of boxes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re better cigars than I can afford to
smoke,” remarked the superintendent. “The job
of special delegate must pay pretty well.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Nixon laughed again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, so, so,” he said, and tilting his chair back,
rammed his hands deep in his trousers’ pockets.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long have you held it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Three years—an’ there’s never been a breath
of complaint against me. If any man stands square
with the brotherhood, it’s me,” and again Nixon
grinned sardonically.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Schofield’s last trace of uncertainty had vanished.
He knew his ground now and could advance
more surely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” he went on, slowly, “we won’t reinstate
Bassett, and at the same time we’re going to avoid
a strike, if we can. I think you remarked the other
day that there would be no strike unless you called
it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There won’t,” said Nixon, briefly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What will happen, then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll make a report adverse to Bassett and he’ll
be kicked out of the brotherhood?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Won’t he make a howl?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let him. What good will it do? My report
goes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Schofield nodded, as he watched the cigar
smoke float slowly upward.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see,” he commented, and there was a moment’s
silence. “Suppose,” he went on, at last,
“that you were convinced that it was your duty
to make such a report, what assurance would we
have that you would really make it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’d have to take my word,” said Nixon.
“You could count on me making the report, all
right, if I was properly convinced.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I suppose,” continued Mr. Schofield,
“that you would have to be—ah—convinced in
advance.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This was a new experience for him and he was
considerably the more confused of the two.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing,” answered Nixon, bluntly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll see if I can convince you. Bassett
was drunk, he was insolent to his superior officer;
to reinstate him would mean the end of discipline
on this line. His offence falls clearly under rule
forty-three, which says that no employee of the
road, on duty or off, shall frequent saloons. In
violating that rule, he laid himself liable to discharge
and discharged he was. He also violated
rule sixty-one, which says that insolence to a superior
officer may be punished by dismissal, at the
discretion of the train master. The train master
exercised his discretion and dismissed him. When
Bassett was employed by the road he was given
a copy of the rules and knew that he must obey
them if he wanted to hold his job. He disobeyed
them, and lost it—so he’s got nobody to blame
but himself. That’s our position. Don’t you think
it’s a pretty strong one?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” agreed Nixon, slowly, “it looks pretty
strong,” but he was plainly waiting for something
that was still to come.</p>

<p class='c013'>“By the way,” continued Mr. Schofield, opening
a drawer of his desk. “After you left the other
day, I found this package on the floor,” and he
took from the drawer a little packet, carefully
wrapped and sealed, and laid it on his desk. “It
doesn’t belong to anyone around here, and I
thought maybe you’d dropped it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s see it,” said Nixon, and took it with
eager fingers. He ripped open the seal and drew
out a little bundle of paper currency. He ran
through it rapidly and found it to consist of ten
one hundred dollar bills. “Yes,” he said, slipping
them into an inside pocket. “It’s mine. I’d been
wondering what had become of it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you’re convinced?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perfectly, I’ll report against Bassett.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Nixon glanced at his watch and started to his
feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right away,” he said. “The meeting’s called
for ten-thirty. I’ll just have time to get there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He picked up hat and overcoat and started for
the door. Mr. Schofield, his finger hovering over
an electric button, watched him with a perplexed
pucker of the forehead. Then his face cleared,
and he took his hand away from the button.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, good-bye,” he said. “I’m glad we could
settle it so easily.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, nobody never has no trouble with me,”
said Nixon, “if they talk business,” and he opened
the door and closed it after him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two men, who—so a single glance told him—were
not railroad men, were standing just across
the hall, looking out of a window. They glanced
around, as he came out, but made no effort to
molest him, and he hurried away, the packet in his
inside pocket pressing against his breast with a
most reassuring warmth.</p>

<p class='c013'>And just as he disappeared down the stairs, the
door of Mr. Schofield’s room opened and the two
strangers were called hastily inside.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c006'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>MR. SCHOFIELD’S BOMBSHELL</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>T<span class='sc'>he</span> meeting room of Scioto lodge, B. of L. E.,
was jammed to the doors. Every member who
was off duty and who could by any possibility attend,
was present. Many of them had come in
from the road only a short time before, and in the
ordinary course of things, would have gone home,
got something to eat, and gone to bed; but the
present crisis took the place of food and sleep, and
its excitement robbed them of desire for either.</p>

<p class='c013'>The meeting hall was on the third floor of a
brick building only a short distance from the station.
It was reached by two long flights of steep
and narrow stairs, and was cold and scantily furnished
and uninviting. At various points about
the room, large arm chairs stood on little platforms,
these being the stations for the officers of the lodge,
when going through the intricacies of the ritual.
Rows of smaller chairs were pushed back along
the walls, there was a table or two—and that was
all.</p>

<p class='c013'>On this bright morning in late January, as has
been said, the hall was crowded. A group had
gathered around Bassett, who was declaiming excitedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s our chance,” he was saying. “Now’s the
time t’show the road who’s boss. You know well
enough all the other orders’ll stand by us, an’ we’ll
tie the division up so tight it can’t turn a wheel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The younger men nodded emphatically, but a
few of the older ones looked grave. They had
been through strikes before, and knew that they did
not always turn out as the strikers anticipated.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know,” put in one of them, hesitatingly.
“I don’t believe we’ll ever be able to boss the road.
It don’t look right. If you had a business, you’d
want to run it, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” flashed Bassett. “But I’d run it square.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“O’ course; we kin do our best to make ’em
run it square.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, that’s all we’re tryin’ to do now, ain’t
it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some o’ you fellers seem to be hopin’ there’ll
be a strike. Mebbe they’ll reinstate Bassett.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe they will,” growled that worthy, “but
I don’t believe it. They ain’t got manhood enough
to do that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In his heart, he knew that he had been wrong,
and did not deserve reinstatement; but this consciousness
of guilt interfered in no way with the
bold face he turned to the world, and the loud voice
in which he proclaimed his wrongs. And a bold
face and loud voice often have great weight with
the unthinking, who mistake them for the earmarks
of innocence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I hope they will,” said another of the
older men, wistfully. “I ain’t in no sort o’ shape
to stand a strike.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I ain’t either,” put in one of the younger men,
boldly, “but that don’t make no difference. I’d
ruther starve ’n work fer a company as wouldn’t
do the right thing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all right to starve yourself,” rejoined the
older man. “I used t’ feel that way, too; but
when it comes t’ starvin’ yer family, it’s a different
matter—mighty different.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” added another, “an’ when a feller’s
built a house an’ is payin’ fer it in the Buildin’ an’
Loan, a strike don’t look good, neither. If a feller
can’t make his payments, he loses his house, without
any ifs or ands about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pshaw!” put in the young fellow, easily.
“The brotherhood’ll take care of you. You won’t
starve nor lose your house, neither.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe not. But if I loses my job, a lot o’
good my house’ll do me, won’t it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lose yer job? How kin you do that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Easy enough. I’ve seen—”</p>

<p class='c013'>But a sudden shout from the door interrupted
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here’s Nixon! Here’s Nixon!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And the great man was half-pushed, half-carried
forward to the platform at the end of the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>He smiled about to those on the right and left
of him, and finally mounted the platform and deliberately
removed overcoat and hat. A close observer
might have seen that he was very nervous,
but he held himself well in hand. The truth is,
Nixon had not anticipated so large an outpouring
nor such intense interest in the case and in consequence,
found the task confronting him considerably
more difficult than he had thought it would
be.</p>

<p class='c013'>He took out his handkerchief and passed it over
his moist moustache, for he had stopped in the
saloon on the first floor to take a single “bracer,”
then he held up his hand impressively for silence.
Nixon believed in doing a thing dramatically.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, boys,” he announced, “I’ve seen Schofield.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What did he say?” shouted one of the men,
impatient of Nixon’s deliberate manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, look here,” yelled Nixon, searching the
offender out with threatening forefinger, “I won’t
be interrupted—I won’t! If another man does that,
I leave—an’ I’ll let y’ wait a week fer a letter
from headquarters. You don’t seem t’ realize what
it means fer a man like me t’ come down here t’
settle your rows.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s what you’re paid fer,” murmured one
of the men, in a far corner, but he lowered his voice
carefully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Schofield an’ I went over the situation from
a to izzard,” Nixon continued, when quiet was
restored, satisfied that there would be no further
interruptions. “He gave me the case from the
road’s side, and I gave him the case from our side,
and I can’t deny that he had the best of me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a little murmur at this, but Nixon
stilled it instantly with raised finger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The fact of the matter is,” he went on, raising
his voice suddenly and glowering at Bassett, who
occupied a place in the front line, “this man Bassett
was drunk the other night, and every mother’s son
of you knows it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a lie!” yelled Bassett, white as death, and
again there was a murmur, but again Nixon managed
to still it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll answer <i>you</i>,” he said, pointing to Bassett,
“after this meetin’ adjourns. I ain’t here to argue.
I’m here to state facts. This man was drunk an’
insulted his superior officer. The road had a right
to fire him on two counts—fer bein’ drunk an’
fer insubordination.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He paused an instant and glowered around.
There had been a little movement at the door a
few minutes before, and Mr. Schofield had stepped
quietly inside, followed by the two men whom
Nixon had seen standing in the hall outside the
superintendent’s office. But so intent was everyone
on what Nixon was saying that no one observed
them, and they stood watching the proceedings
without question or interference.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, I’m going to give it to you fellers
straight,” continued Nixon. “You need it. You’ve
been makin’ a little tin god of this feller and he
ain’t worth it. Now my advice to you is, drop
him. Kick him out. At any rate, the grand lodge
won’t back you up if you try to call a strike about
this, and you know what that means. It means
that your charter will be taken away from you and
the lodge disbanded. The grand lodge will see every
time that you get your rights, but it won’t back
you up when you’re as clearly in the wrong as you
are now. Why, to call a strike for a thing like that
would be suicide. Let me tell you boys something—you’ll
never win any strike unless you have the
public with you. If the public’s against you, sooner
or later you’ll be going back to work like whipped
curs—an’ you’ll be lucky if you kin get your old
jobs. An’ I guess that’s all,” he concluded, mopping
his forehead with his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then his eyes rested on three men who had been
gradually working their way toward the stage, and
he caught his breath sharply. But in an instant, by
a mighty effort, he had recovered his self-control.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Boys,” he said, “here’s Mr. Schofield himself.
I’m glad he’s with us. I want to say that I’ve
found him a square man.” There was a little flutter
of applause at this, for most of them had themselves
found him to be a square man. “We would
all be glad to have Mr. Schofield address us a few
words,” added Nixon, but he glanced at the superintendent
apprehensively, as the latter, in response
to the invitation, stepped with alacrity upon the
platform.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Mr. Schofield, turning and facing
the expectant audience, “I want to say a few words
to you. I have heard what Mr. Nixon has been
saying—I have listened to him with great pleasure.
For I believe that what he has told you is true—in
the first place, that the road was right in discharging
Bassett and in refusing to reinstate him, and in
the second place that no strike can succeed unless
it has the public behind it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Here he glanced at Nixon, who had seated himself
in the president’s chair and who was nodding
from time to time, as Mr. Schofield proceeded,
every trace of apprehension banished from his
countenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But before I go further,” Mr. Schofield continued,
“I ought, perhaps, to apologize for my
presence here. I had intended, of course, to ask
permission to enter, but there wasn’t anybody at
the door, nor anybody to ask, so I just came in.
I ask permission now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all right,” shouted one of the men, “go
ahead,” and it was evident from their smiling faces
that everyone present concurred in the invitation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you,” said Mr. Schofield. “And now,”
he continued, more seriously, “I have something
to say to you. As I said, I was glad to hear Mr.
Nixon’s sentiments and to see that, on the whole,
you agreed with him. I certainly think that the
road was right in the stand it took, and I believe all
of you will agree with me when you think it over.
You have always found the road ready to meet you
half way in any reasonable demand, but we’ve got
to maintain discipline or quit business. And, after
all—and here I’m talking very frankly to you—it’s
we who are running the road and not you. Of
course, if you don’t like the job, you can quit it—we
don’t quarrel with that; but, if you are really
fair-minded, you will see our side, too, which is
that if you break the rules, you must take the consequences.
When you take employment with the
road, you agree to obey the rules, and you can’t
object if the road holds you to the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The superintendent was evidently carrying the
crowd with him, and he paused a moment before
launching his bombshell. Should he launch it, he
asked himself, or should he let well enough alone?
There would be no strike, everything had been
quietly smoothed over. Nixon had carried out his
agreement. Was it not wiser to stop now and let
affairs take their course? Then the remembrance
of Allan West’s flushed and indignant face rose
before him and he nerved himself to go on.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So I was interested to hear Mr. Nixon’s opinions,”
he said, slowly, “and I thought you might
be interested in knowing how Mr. Nixon arrived
at them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At the words, Nixon turned livid and half-started
from his chair, but Mr. Schofield heard
the movement and turned toward him sternly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sit down,” he said, curtly, and the two men
who had come in with him moved closer to Nixon’s
chair. “This representative of yours,” he continued,
impressively, “came to me this morning. I
told him we had decided not to reinstate Bassett.
He said that in that case, there would be a strike—a
general strike—that would cost us thousands
of dollars. He hinted that the stock-yards would
be set afire and other damage done to the company’s
property. But in the end, he agreed to report
against Bassett and prevent a strike, in consideration
of the payment to him of the sum of
one thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The room woke up at the words as though a
cyclone had suddenly broken loose. Nixon was on
his feet, shaking his great fist at the speaker, who
was himself trembling with excitement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I paid him the money,” shouted Mr. Schofield,
in a voice which dominated even that tumult, “and
he delivered the goods!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The words fanned the flames anew, for a moment,
and then a sudden silence fell upon the
crowd, as Bassett sprang to the platform.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If this thing’s true,” he shouted, his face as
white as Nixon’s, “we want proofs. I’ve stood
here an’ heard myself called a drunkard an’ liar,
but I don’t care. I want proof.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you shall have proof,” retorted Mr. Schofield,
“if you’ll be quiet a minute. That’s right—don’t
let him get away,” he added, as Nixon
tried to slip from the platform and was promptly
collared by the two strangers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who are you?” demanded the prisoner, white
with rage. “Leggo me or I’ll knock you down!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no, you won’t, Johnny,” rejoined one of
them calmly, and showed his shield.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Detectives!” gasped Nixon.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Exactly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me set down,” said Nixon, faintly, and
sank back into the chair from which he had arisen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now,” continued the superintendent, when that
little by-play was ended, “if you’ll listen a moment,
I’ll give you your proof. I had intended to have
Nixon arrested as he left my office, but when he
told me he was coming right over here, I thought
it would be more convincing to all of you if I made
the disclosure here. My proof is, that in the inside
pocket of Nixon’s coat there is a package of
ten one hundred dollar bills. They are notes issued
by the First National Bank of this city, and range
from number A142320 to A142329. As a further
mark of identification, each of them has a
small cross in red ink just over the head of the
eagle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Bassett sprang toward the crouching man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll see!” he cried savagely, and ripping
Nixon’s coat open plunged his hand into the inside
pocket.</p>

<p class='c013'>An instant later, he snatched it out again, and
waved the packet of bills in the air over his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s true!” he yelled. “He’s sold us!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And he turned upon Nixon as though to rend
him limb from limb, while the mob pressed forward
like so many maddened beasts.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c006'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>DECLARATION OF WAR</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>F<span class='sc'>or</span> a moment, it looked as though summary vengeance
would be taken upon the special delegate.
But the detectives were equal to the occasion. One
of them snapped a pair of handcuffs on the wrists of
the cowering man, while the other snatched out a
revolver and faced the shrieking mob.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stand back!” he cried, and when Bassett
pressed on, caught him by the collar and flung
him away. “Let the law deal with this man. Don’t
make fools of yourselves! You’ll be sorry for it
afterwards!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s right!” shouted Mr. Schofield. “Keep
your heads, men! Bassett, sit down!” and he
caught the engineer, who was literally foaming at
the mouth in a spasm of hate and anger, and flung
him into a chair.</p>

<p class='c013'>The frenzy was over in a moment; cooler heads
went about among the crowd counselling patience,
and, in the end, Nixon was led away between the
two detectives, a very different man from the self-assured,
impudent fellow who had entered the room
a short time before. Mr. Schofield accompanied
them, having first seen that one of the detectives
secured the packet of bills from Bassett to hold for
evidence. And it may be added here, in passing,
since Nixon will not again appear in the pages of
this story, that he was, in due course, brought to
trial, convicted of blackmail and sentenced to a
term of years in the penitentiary.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>There was a moment’s silence after Nixon and
his captors had left the hall. None of the engineers
followed them, but lingered behind, looking inquiringly
into each others’ faces, for they seemed to
feel that there was still something to be said.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bassett seemed to feel so, too, for as soon as
Mr. Schofield and the detectives left the room, he
made his way to the door, closed it carefully, and
placed a man on guard beside it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now you stay there,” he said. “We don’t want
no more interruptions.”</p>

<p class='c013'>That done, he strode to the other end of the hall
and mounted the platform.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, boys,” he said, “we’ve certainly had an
eye-opener. Most of you were against me half an
hour ago, but maybe you feel different now. We’ve
allers known that there was some scoundrels among
these special delegates, but I guess there’s goin’ t’
be one less now, an’ anyway none of ’em would dare
try t’ work the same thing twice. I move that the
secretary be instructed to send an account of this
thing to the grand secretary, at once, an’ ask fer
another delegate t’ be sent down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Second the motion!” shouted some one, and
it was carried with a roar.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now,” concluded Bassett, “I guess there
ain’t nothing more to be said at present. But this
thing ain’t ended yet—not by no manner o’
means.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, it ain’t!” shouted one of the men. “An’
there’s another thing. After this, we’re back of
Rafe Bassett—hey, boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You bet!” came the chorus.</p>

<p class='c013'>And when Bassett stepped down from the platform,
it was in the guise of a hero. Everyone
wanted to shake his hand and to protest undying
devotion. He was enthroned more firmly than ever
in control of the lodge, and everyone was anxious,
as the saying is, to get into the band-wagon.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bassett was right in saying that the incident was
not closed. Indeed, it seemed that it had scarcely
begun.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nixon’s arrest and exposure created the biggest
kind of a sensation. Newspapers described it under
display heads, commented upon it editorially, and
battledored and shuttlecocked it around until every
phase of it was exhausted. But, curiously enough,
while every compliment was paid Mr. Schofield for
exposing Nixon, the whole affair seemed rather
to incline the public to sympathize with Bassett.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This exposé,” as one paper expressed it, “in no
way affects the merits of the case. Indeed, it rather
indicates that, without a bribe, the special delegate
would have reported in Bassett’s favour. While
the courage of the P. &amp; O. in undertaking to expose
the scoundrel cannot but be commended, the public
should not permit this grand-stand play, as it were,
to obscure the main issue. Whether the road was
wrong, or whether Bassett was wrong, is a question
whose solution we must await with an open mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The labour papers were much more outspoken.
While all of them rejoiced ostentatiously in the detection
and punishment of Nixon, they also took
care to add that the fact that the railroad had to
bribe Nixon in order to get a favourable report
from him proved beyond a doubt that its case was
a bad one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This entire occurrence,” one of them continued,
and not the most rabid by any means, “moves
us to inquire on how many occasions have the railroads
used bribery in order to accomplish their
ends? No one can doubt that the use of money for
this purpose is habitual with them, and we should
not forget that the bribe-giver is as guilty as the
bribe-taker. No bribe is ever given to accomplish
an honest purpose, and the great corporations,
which know so well how to take advantage of the
weaknesses of poor human nature, are more to be
despised and abhorred than the pitiable victims
whom they have tempted to their ruin.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was in Mr. Round’s office at Cincinnati that
Mr. Schofield was shown this utterance, and the
general manager watched him as he read it, a cynical
smile upon his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You see what’s coming, don’t you?” he inquired,
when Mr. Schofield looked up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What <i>is</i> coming?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A strike—and public sympathy is going to
be on the other side.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You think so?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know so. I’m afraid we made a mistake,
Schofield, in peaching on Nixon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you know,” said the superintendent, “I
felt a sort of presentiment of that sort when I
started in to give him away. I came mighty near
not doing it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wish you hadn’t. Why didn’t you heed the
presentiment?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” answered Mr. Schofield, slowly, “in the
first place, we had mapped out the plan to follow,
and I didn’t quite feel like discarding it on my own
motion. And in the second place—well—I’m
almost ashamed to tell you—just as I shut my
mouth and got ready to sit down, I remembered
young West’s face as it looked when I spoke of
bribery to him. Somehow, I just had to go on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was scarcely the time to heed a young idealist,”
said Mr. Round, dryly. “But I’m not blaming
you—the mistake was mine, and I take the responsibility
for it. I flattered myself that I adopted
the course I did from purely utilitarian motives,
but I’m inclined to suspect that West’s enthusiasm
had something to do with my decision. You can’t
mix railroading and impractical idealism, Ed.; the
railroading will suffer every time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” agreed Mr. Schofield, “I’m afraid it will.
It certainly has this time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ve got to make the best of it, and do what
we can to set things right again. That’s mighty
little. About all we can do is to get ready for the
strike, and to hope that the strikers will make some
fool move early in the game that will disgust thinking
people. They’re pretty sure to, and that’s what
I’m counting on to help us win out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And in the meantime?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll keep our trains moving!” and Mr. Round
closed his jaws with a snap. “Here’s what I’m
counting on. The engineers and firemen will strike
sure—the conductors and brakemen probably.
The hardest to replace will be the engineers, and
I’m already getting some extra ones under my hand.
Within a week, I think we’ll have all we need, if
we can protect them. The firemen and brakemen
won’t be so hard to get—there’s always a lot hanging
around who don’t belong to the union, and as
for conductors—well, I’m going to put as many
men from these offices and yours on the job as can
be spared. Clerical work can wait a while. Our
secret service is lining up a lot of dependable men
to be used as special deputies, and in a week I think
I’ll have everything in shape. The only thing is,”
he added, sadly, “we won’t have the public with
us from the start.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course, if it lasts long enough, there’ll be
trouble,” observed Mr. Schofield.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s what I expect—that’s what I’m hoping
for—for that’s what is going to win us public
sympathy. As soon as any trouble develops that
our men can’t handle, we’ll call for the state troops.
The governor will be with us,” he added; “that’s
one mercy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I thought,” began Mr. Schofield, with a
vivid remembrance of the rabid anti-corporation
campaign the governor had made, “I thought he
was all the other way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s seen a light,” said Mr. Round, briefly,
and while he made no further explanation, it is safe
to assume that it was this same light, discovered by
the governor soon after taking his seat, which led
him eventually to the senate of the United States.</p>

<p class='c013'>“At any rate,” said Mr. Schofield, glancing at
his watch and rising, “I’m glad to know that you’ve
got everything so well in hand. I fancy the engineers
will hustle things along as fast as they can.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And they did, for the engineers realized, as well
as the railroad, the value of public opinion. Another
delegate was sent from headquarters without
delay, and, fully cognizant of the way the wind
was blowing, announced that a strike would be
called at once, if Bassett was not reinstated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next morning, the delegate, accompanied by
a local committee, waited upon Mr. Schofield. The
interview was short and to the point.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have gone over the case,” said the delegate,
who was a very different individual from Nixon,
“and I find that you exceeded your rights in discharging
Bassett.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So there’s no use to argue the point, then,”
said Mr. Schofield.</p>

<p class='c013'>“None whatever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course your decision was thoroughly unbiased?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thoroughly so,” answered the delegate with
perfect composure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We demand that Bassett be reinstated at once.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And we unqualifiedly refuse.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well, sir. You know, I suppose, that
there is then only one course open to us?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose you mean you’ll call a strike?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Much as we regret to do so,” said the delegate
with unction, “that is what we shall have to
do.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have a picture of your regret,” said Mr. Schofield,
grimly. “I’m going to have it framed.
When will the strike begin?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At noon to-morrow,” answered the delegate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’ve figured this thing out? You know
what it will mean to the men?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What will it mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will mean that they’ll have to begin at the
bottom again, so far as this road is concerned.
They’ll never get their old places back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is that a threat?” asked the delegate, flushing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; it’s a statement of fact.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I guess we can take the consequences.
Of course, you’ve figured it out from your side?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thoroughly,” Mr. Schofield answered. “You
say the strike begins at noon to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All trains on the road, I suppose, will be taken
on to their destinations?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They will be taken to the terminus of the division.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And there will be no disorder or attempt to interfere
with the operation of the road?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not if we can help it,” replied the delegate,
smiling grimly. “The brotherhood is always on
the side of law and order. Come on, boys,” and
he led the committee from the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two minutes later, Mr. Schofield had Mr. Round
on the wire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was just notified,” he wired, “that the strike
will be called at noon to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” flashed back the general manager.
“We’ll be ready for them. Will get orders forward
to you soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“O. K.,” clicked Mr. Schofield. Then he sent
his stenographer to summon Mr. Plumfield and
Allan West, and devoted the few minutes before
they appeared to the study of the time-card.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, boys,” he began, when they were seated,
“I suppose you know there’s going to be a
strike.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” nodded Mr. Plumfield, “it’s all over the
place.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It starts at noon to-morrow. The engineers
will go out and I suppose the firemen will, too,
right away. But how about the conductors and
brakemen?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t believe the conductors will go out without
orders from headquarters,” said the train master
reflectively. “And maybe they won’t get orders.
You know they have been mighty careful recently
about engaging in any sympathy strikes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know they have, and I suppose the
brakemen will stay as long as the conductors do.
But it’s going to be quite a job to get engineers
and firemen to move our trains. We’ve got a total
of sixty-two regular trains in both directions every
day, and thirty-eight of them are passengers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But a lot of them are suburban trains running
between Cincinnati and Loveland,” put in Allan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” agreed the superintendent, consulting the
time-card. “Twenty of them are. Of course they
can be doubled back and forth, and some of them
can be taken off, if necessary. But there must be
no interference with the road’s through traffic. At
12.15 to-morrow—fifteen minutes after the strike
commences—Number Four, our through flier,
leaves Cincinnati—and it’s going to leave on time,
if I have to take it out myself. I haven’t forgotten
how to run an engine, George.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Neither have I,” laughed the train master;
“nor how to fire, either. But that’s only one train.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Round has been getting some men together
on the quiet. He knew this thing was coming,
and did his best to get ready for it. I only
hope he’s got enough.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course we’ll win,” said Allan, hopefully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If we don’t, it won’t be for lack of trying,”
answered Mr. Schofield grimly. “There’s Mr.
Round,” he added, as the sounder on his desk
wakened suddenly to life.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s Round,” chattered the instrument, when
Mr. Schofield had given the go-ahead signal. “I
have ten crews here ready for duty. They will live
for the present in our offices. I will send eight
more crews to Wadsworth to-night. Arrange to
lodge and board them in the freight-house, also
instruct local officer to swear in ten deputies to
protect them—more if necessary. Get as many
more local men as you can. You ought to be able
to get a good many firemen among men out of
work. Eight crews will arrive at Parkersburg
from east to-night. If any symptom of trouble,
notify sheriff. If he won’t act promptly, notify
me and I’ll get troops. Strikers must be kept away
from new men at any cost and company’s property
protected. Arrest for trespass any found on company’s
property. Round.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“O. K.,” Mr. Schofield clicked back. “I understand.
Good work. That makes a total of twenty-six
crews,” he added, turning to his companions.
“And if by crews, he means conductors and brakemen
too, we’re pretty well fixed for the present.
What do you think about getting local men,
George?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wouldn’t do it unless it’s absolutely necessary,”
answered the train master. “You can’t keep
local men shut up, and as sure as we let them go
home, the strikers will get them. It will be inviting
trouble right away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know but what you’re right,” agreed
Mr. Schofield, after a moment’s thought. “We’ll
let that go for the present. I’ve got plenty to do
as it is,” and he hastened away to give the orders
necessary to prepare the freight-house for the reception
of the new men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fifty cots were secured, a cook-stove, tables and
chairs, some light bed-clothing and a lot of tin
dishes. Rude shelves were nailed up along the
wall and a supply of canned vegetables, ham and
bacon, coffee, sugar, condensed milk, molasses,
flour, cornmeal, potatoes and other staples piled
upon them, or heaped along the floor beneath. A
cook from a small up-town café was hired and the
superintendent did not forget to order in a case of
tobacco, some decks of cards, dominoes, checkers,
and a lot of illustrated papers. For the success of
almost any strike-breaking depends on keeping
the strike-breakers amused, in seeing that they are
well-fed, and in taking care that they hold no communication
with the strikers. Mr. Schofield proposed
to take no chances of failure in any of these
directions.</p>

<p class='c013'>While these preparations were being made, he
called in the local detective employed by the road—a
tall, raw-boned fellow named Stanley, a miracle
of aggressiveness and nerve and with no little detective
ability—and explained the situation to him.
An hour later, that worthy marched into the mayor’s
office at the head of ten husky men.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I want to get these fellows sworn in, Your
Honor,” he said. “I guess you’ve heard about the
strike.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The mayor looked down from his desk in some
perturbation. The railroad element formed a very
important portion of his clientele, and he was anxious
to do nothing to offend it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now see here, Stanley,” he said, “you don’t
need all this force. We’re not going to have any
fighting here. If you need help, I’ll furnish it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Orders is orders, sir,” said Stanley. “I was
told to git ten men, an’ I’ve got ’em.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What are you going to do with them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guard the company’s property, sir,” answered
Stanley, promptly, for he knew the proper answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it in danger?” inquired the mayor, with
irony.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will be after to-morrow noon, sir. Besides,
we’re going to get in a lot of strike-breakers to-night
and we’re going to see that they’re not interfered
with. And then I’ve got to patrol the
yards and keep out trespassers. You see I’ve got
a pretty big job on hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The mayor considered gloomily for a moment;
but he really had no choice in the matter, so he
reluctantly swore the men in, and handed each of
them a special officer’s badge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now I just want to say one thing to you fellows,”
he said, when this ceremony was finished.
“These badges and the oath you have just taken
give you authority to see that the law is observed—in
other words, to see that no right, either of
property or person, is interfered with. But they
don’t give you a right to engage in a riot or to
molest anybody who isn’t molesting you. Above
all, they don’t give you a right to use your guns
indiscriminately, and if any innocent person is hurt
by you, some of you are going to suffer. I’ll see
to that. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Word of their presence at the mayor’s office had
got about, and a little crowd, principally of boys,
awaited them outside. When they made their appearance,
they were greeted by a chorus of yells,
mostly from the aforesaid boys.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t mind ’em,” said Stanley, quietly. “It’s
only a lot of kids,” and he marched them off in the
direction of the station.</p>

<p class='c013'>The crowd followed, growing larger as it went,
but it came to a halt when the freight-house was
reached and the deputies entered, closing the door
behind them. Two or three stones were thrown,
but a couple of policemen, sent by the mayor, soon
arrived, and compelled the crowd to disperse.</p>

<p class='c013'>At nine o’clock that night, forty-eight strike-breakers
alighted from a special coach which had
been attached to the east-bound flier, and were conducted
immediately to the freight-house. There
was a crowd on the station platform to see them
alight, but no effort was made to interfere with
them, though again there was hooting and shouting.
Train master and superintendent watched this demonstration
in silence, and then mounted to their
offices.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you think of it?” asked the former.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know,” answered Mr. Schofield, slowly.
“But I’m afraid there’ll be trouble. Just listen to
that,” and he motioned toward the row of saloons
along the street opposite the yards.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every one of them was ablaze with light, and
every one was crowded, apparently, from the jangle
and roar of voices which came from them, and
which could be heard even above the noise of the
yards. Evidently there was much excitement in
railroad-dom, and the prospect for peace upon the
morrow was not encouraging.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c006'>CHAPTER XV <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>IN CHARGE AT WADSWORTH</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>T<span class='sc'>he</span> P. &amp; O. freight-house at Wadsworth is a
long, low, one-storied brick building which stands
just across the yards from the station. Like the
station, it is dingy and grimy and gritty, as well as
inadequate to the needs of the terminal; but no
attempt was ever made to clean or brighten—much
less to enlarge—it, and its self-respect had
long since disappeared as a result of this neglect.</p>

<p class='c013'>At one end of the building are the offices, where
the freight agent and his clerks labour with reports
and receipts and bills of lading—a mass and complexity
of documents appalling and seemingly inextricable.
The offices are crowded and gloomy and
ill-smelling, for here, too, the road economizes at
the expense of its employees’ health; but their condition
is order and cleanliness itself when compared
with that of the great echoing freight-shed which
occupies three-fourths of the building. No light
penetrates to it except from the doors, for there is
no room for windows, and the doors are overhung
by the wide, low roof which covers the surrounding
platform. As a result, the freight-shed resembles
a cavern in everything but atmosphere. In that, it
resembles only itself; for its atmosphere is a thing
apart, a thing to be encountered nowhere else, compounded
as it is of a variety of odours which defy
enumeration. You have seen composite photographs?
Well, the freight-house atmosphere reminded
one of a composite photograph of particularly
ugly people. It was something to flee from
and wonder at and remember with awe.</p>

<p class='c013'>A wide platform the height of a freight car door
runs all around this portion of the building, abutting
on one side on the yards and on the other on
the street. Behind it, and stretching along between
the yards and the street, is a long platform, an extension
of the one running around the building.
Beside this platform, a long line of freight cars is
always standing—loaded cars from which the
freight is being yanked out into the freight-house,
or empties into which freight from the house is
being hustled. And so various it is—crates, boxes,
barrels, kegs, baskets, loose pieces of steel and iron,
great sacks of burlap—it is impossible to give any
idea of it here. Imagine, if you can, all the things
you ever saw in all the stores in town, and all the
raw material which is used in your town’s manufactures,
and you will find that nearly all of it
came through the freight depot; to say nothing of
your town’s products which go out again. It is a
strenuous place, the freight depot, and the men who
labour there are big-armed and strong-backed and
deep-chested. For theirs is a job that demands
brawn.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the echoing cavern of the freight-shed at
Wadsworth which had been selected by Mr. Round
as headquarters for the strike-breakers, not because
it was particularly adapted to that use, but because
it was the only place available. So the freight on
hand had to be carefully sorted over, the larger
articles taken out and stacked on the platform, the
smaller ones stacked up at the end of the room nearest
the offices, behind a flimsy board partition which
had been hastily nailed up. Behind this barrier the
freight men were instructed to transact their business,
and orders were issued that on no account
should any of them be permitted any intercourse
with the strike-breakers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then some attempt was made to clean the remainder
of the room; the tables and cots were put
in place, the range installed, the cook put to work
arranging his pantry, and the place was ready for
its occupants. These, as has been said, arrived on
the evening train, and were at once marched over
to the place which was to be their home for an indefinite
length of time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under the glare of the gas lights overhead, the
place presented a somewhat more attractive appearance
than it did by day, and the bountiful supper
which was soon provided did its share toward putting
the newcomers in good humour with themselves
and their surroundings. The odour of cooking
had served to mitigate the odour of the freight-house,
and a cloud of tobacco smoke soon wiped
it out altogether. The strike-breakers, under the
softening influence of all this, began to look around
at each other and to take the first steps toward
getting acquainted.</p>

<p class='c013'>For they were strangers to each other; they had
been gathered together hastily from many different
sources, and were as diverse in appearance and, no
doubt, in character, as forty-eight men could be.
None of them, it was evident at once, would rank
very high in the social scale. Most of them were
plainly failures, and a glance at their rubicund and
mottled faces revealed what the principal cause of
failure had been.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But then,” as Mr. Schofield was remarking to
Mr. Plumfield and Allan West, in his office across
the yards, at that very moment, “we can keep drink
away from them for a time, or, at least, give them
just enough to keep them from losing their nerve.
It will be easy enough for the first two or three
days, but after that we’ll have to look out. The
drink hunger will get some of them sure, and they’ll
break away; but most of them will stay, because we
won’t give them any money till payday, and they’re
all broke. Those who want to go, we’ll have to let
go, of course, for we can’t hold them prisoners—though
we’ll be accused of doing it, no matter what
happens. Now what I want to say is this—we
need a man we can trust to make his headquarters
in that freight-house and to keep his eye out for
trouble. And, Allan, I’m going to give you charge
of the situation here. Mr. Plumfield and myself
will have to be looking after matters at other points
on the line—I’m going to Cincinnati to-morrow
and George will go to Parkersburg. I don’t believe
there’s as much chance of trouble here as there is at
Cincinnati, where a mob of thugs and toughs can
be collected in no time; or at a river town like
Parkersburg, where there are always a lot of roust-abouts
looking for trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know,” said Mr. Plumfield, slowly.
“There are more railroad men here than at any
other point on the division, since this is division
headquarters. And the entire police force consists
of about a dozen men.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know that,” replied the superintendent; “but
there’s mighty few of the railroad men who will
give us any trouble; even if they did want to, in
a small town like this everybody knows them, and
a man doesn’t begin to riot and destroy property
where he’s generally known—he’s too likely to be
caught and punished. Anyway, Allan must take
the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, sir,” said Allan. “I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now who’s the right man to put over there
in the freight-house?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Reddy Magraw,” answered Allan, promptly.
“He’s true blue and as sharp as a steel trap.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Schofield nodded his approval.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The very man,” he agreed. “Will you see
him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir; right away,” and a moment later he
was hurrying away in the direction of Reddy’s
home.</p>

<p class='c013'>It may be explained in passing that, in Reddy
Magraw’s home, Allan West was regarded with
a degree of veneration and affection possible only
to warm Irish hearts.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the old days, by an accident, it is true, he had
brought Reddy out of a dangerous condition of
insanity, and, since that time, any member of the
Magraw household would have cheerfully risked
life and limb for him. So, when, in answer to
his knock, Mrs. Magraw opened the door, her
honest Irish face lighted with pleasure at sight of
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, good avenin’, Mister West,” she cried.
“Won’t ye come in?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I surely will,” said Allan. “But since when
have I been ‘Mister’ West?” he added, laughingly,
as he stepped inside.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Iver since you’ve been chief dispatcher,” answered
Mrs. Magraw promptly, leading the way
and holding the lamp carefully so that he could see.
“Indade, we knows our place, sir, an’ it’s not fer
the likes of us t’ be gittin’ too familiar with the
chief dispatcher.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense, Mrs. Magraw,” laughed Allan.
“I’m just the same fellow I always was—I
haven’t changed a bit.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not in yer heart, God bless ye. I know that
ain’t changed an’ niver will be. Reddy,” she added,
opening the door and showing Allan into the room
which served as dining-room and sitting-room,
“Reddy, here’s Mister West.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mister West?” echoed Reddy, looking up in
surprise. “Who d’ye— Oh, how are ye, Allan,”
he cried, recognizing the visitor, and springing to
his feet with hand outstretched.</p>

<p class='c013'>“First rate, thank you. And I’m glad you remember
my first name, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh,” said Reddy, “the ole woman’s been so
stuck up iver since ye got your promotion you’d
think it was me. It’s been Mister West this an’
Mister West that, till half the time I didn’t know
who she was talkin’ about. Won’t you set down?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” answered Allan, getting out of his coat,
which Mrs. Magraw was waiting to receive. “I’ve
come for a little talk. Oh, don’t send them away,
Mrs. Magraw,” he added quickly, for at his words,
that lady had begun to herd the children out of the
room. “They won’t be in the way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, they will, sir,” she contradicted. “Besides,
little pitchers has big ears; though if I iver
caught one o’ them kids repatin’ anything ye didn’t
want repated, I’d kill him, I would, an’ think it
good riddance. But it’s best t’ be on the safe side,
an’ they’ll be very well off in the kitchen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The two youngest were protesting somewhat
lustily that they did not think they would be at all
well off in the kitchen, and immensely preferred to
remain where they could continue to gaze at the
illustrious visitor; but their mother was inexorable,
and banished the whole herd together.</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ now,” said Reddy, when that had been
safely accomplished and the door was shut, “what
is it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know the strike begins to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you know what it’s about?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes. But I can’t hardly believe it. Neither
kin anybody else who knows that drunken Rafe
Bassett. It’s about him, ain’t it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—we’ve fired him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ small blame to ye.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And we won’t take him back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ right ye are. I hope ye’ll fight it out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We intend to. Mr. Schofield has placed me in
charge of the situation here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ they couldn’t ’a’ got anybody better,” put
in Reddy, with conviction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m going to do the best I can, anyway—and
I want you to help.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m ready.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know we brought in a lot of men to-night
to take the place of the strikers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Reddy nodded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ve got the freight-house fitted up for them,
and Stanley has a detail of men guarding it. You
know as well as I do that the only way to hold
those men is to keep the strikers away from them.
Stanley can keep guard all right on the outside,
but we’ve got to have somebody to keep guard on
the inside. I want you to go to work there as a
kind of head bottle-washer, and keep your eyes
open for trouble. At the first sign of it, let me
know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Reddy nodded again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” he said. “I ain’t much at bottle-washin’,
but I knows how t’ kape my eyes open an’
my ears too. When do I begin?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The sooner the better.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll go over right away, then,” and Reddy took
down his hat and put on his coat. “Good-bye,
old woman,” he added to his wife, who had been
sitting listening silently to all this. “Look fer me
back whin ye see me comin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He patted her on the back and started for the
door. Mrs. Magraw paused to help Allan into
his overcoat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You won’t be lettin’ nothin’ happen t’ him,
Allan?” she asked, anxiously, forgetting his new
title in the emotion of the moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That I won’t,” he assured her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got a sort o’ feelin’ that there’s goin’ t’ be
trouble, an’ that Reddy’ll be in it,” she added. “It
come t’ me strong when I set there listenin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps there will be trouble, Mrs. Magraw,”
said Allan. “Indeed, I’ll be surprised if there isn’t.
But we’ll come through all right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I hope so, sir!” she cried, and lighted him
to the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>She stood in the open doorway holding the lamp
above her head as he and Reddy started together
down the path to the gate. They had almost
reached it, when Reddy suddenly paused, rubbed
his forehead perplexedly, and then glanced around
at the figure in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got t’ go back a minute,” he said, apologetically.
“You go ahead. I’ll ketch up with
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan walked on slowly, then, at the gate, he
looked around. Reddy was holding Mrs. Magraw
in his arms, kissing her as tenderly as any lover.
The quick moisture sprang to Allan’s eyes; he
closed the gate behind him, and started across the
yards; for Reddy’s house was perched on an embankment
which had been left when the lower yards
had been graded down to their present level. A
minute later, he heard quick steps behind him and
Reddy came running up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I jest had t’ go back,” he explained, a little
shamefacedly. “I don’t know what it was—but
somethin’ kind o’ took me by the elbow an’ steered
me around. Mighty queer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They walked on together in silence to the freight-house.
As soon as they approached it, they were
challenged sharply, and stopped by one of the deputies.
Stanley, attracted by the noise, came up a
moment later and passed them through.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nobody can come through that line, day or
night, unless I say so,” he explained. “I’m not
going to take any chances.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s right,” agreed Allan heartily. “Mr.
Stanley, this is Reddy Magraw.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Stanley. “I know him. He’s all
right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m glad you think so. I’m putting him on the
inside to keep his eyes open. He’ll report to you,
but you oughtn’t to be seen talking together too
much. You’ll report to me, or send him on to me,
when you can.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, Mr. West. I’d suggest that he comes
along after while and asks the cook for a job.
He’d better not make his first appearance with you
and me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s a good idea. You wait here, Reddy,
till you’re sent for.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right,” agreed Reddy, and sat down on the
platform.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stanley opened the door of the freight-house and
led the way in. It was the first time Allan had seen
it in its new incarnation, and it wasn’t exactly what
one would call an attractive scene. Indeed, it was
indescribably sordid. Some of the men had gone
to bed; others were sitting around the tables playing
cards or listlessly turning the leaves of the illustrated
papers. The gas lights overhead flared dimly
through a haze of tobacco smoke. The odour of
cooking still lingered in the air, with onions striking
the high note, and at one end of the room, the
cook was sullenly banging the tin dishes around,
as he made a pretence of washing them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He won’t know Reddy,” said Stanley, in an
aside. “He ain’t been in town long, an’ while he
was here, he never stuck his nose outside that little
joint where he worked. Hello, Sam,” he added, in
a voice which everyone could hear. “It looks to
me like you need some help.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Help!” snarled the cook. “No, I don’t need
no help. That’s a mistake. I’m a wonder, I am.
I kin cook three meals a day fer fifty men, wash th’
dishes, make the beds, an’ do all the other work
without turnin’ a hair. I don’t need no help. I’m
goin’ t’ quit,” he added, in another tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a feller outside askin’ fer a job, an’ I
just happened to think of you,” said Stanley, and
strode to the door. “Here, you,” he called to
Reddy. “Step in here a minute. Here he is, Sam.
What do you think of him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He ain’t no prize beauty,” said the cook, looking
Reddy over critically; “but he looks like he
could work. Anybody’s better’n nobody. I’ll try
him,” and he led Reddy away and set him to work
with the dishes. It was all Allan could do to keep
his face straight, as he saw Reddy, with evident
repugnance, tie a piece of burlap around his waist
for an apron and pick up a dish-cloth.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stanley led the way to one of the groups around
the tables.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Boys,” he said, in a voice which made all
within hearing look up, “this is Mr. West, the
chief dispatcher for this division. He’s in complete
charge of affairs here at Wadsworth, and
he’ll see that you get a square deal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As Allan looked down into the faces gazing up
at him, his heart failed him for an instant. How
could any good work be done with such material?
But he shook the thought away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll have your details ready to-morrow morning,”
he said, “and we’ll see that you are properly
taken care of. We are going to fight this thing
through to a finish, and we rely on your help to
break this strike, for which there wasn’t the
shadow of excuse. I don’t believe there’ll be any
trouble, but we’ll take every precaution and see that
you are thoroughly protected. And when the
strike is over, a permanent position will be open to
every one of you who wants it and who has made
good. I hope that will mean all of you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a little feeble applause at this, but
most of his listeners knew, deep down in their
hearts, that they would not make good, that they
were unfit to hold a permanent position anywhere.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you want anything,” Allan added, “ask for
it. If you’re not comfortable, say so. Be loyal to
the road and the road will be loyal to you. Good
night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But as he left the place and walked slowly homeward,
the futility of his appeal sickened him. Why
should they be loyal to the road—what incentive
was there? How could those weak and hopeless
and degraded creatures be loyal to anything, except
their own desperate needs? They had taken the
job offered them for the money there was in it;
or, perhaps, for the excitement which might follow.
They would be careless and incompetent—it
would be a tremendous task to get any results
from them at all. He had never before appreciated
how difficult it would be. For the railroad was a
machine infinitely complicated, infinitely delicate.
At noon on the morrow, scores of smooth and
nicely-fitting parts would be removed, to be replaced
by rough and ill-fitting ones. Who could
expect the machine to work smoothly—or, indeed,
to work at all,—under such circumstances?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c006'>CHAPTER XVI <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>THE STRIKE BEGINS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>T<span class='sc'>he</span> first day of the strike dawned much as any
winter day might—cold and blustery, with a
threat of snow in the air. It can not be denied that
Allan was exceedingly nervous as he hastened to
work. He stopped first at the freight-house, but
both Stanley and Reddy Magraw reported that
everything there was serene, and that the strikers
had made no effort to interfere with the men who
were to supplant them.</p>

<p class='c013'>About the yards, too, everything was moving as
usual, and Allan began to wonder if he were the
only one to whom the coming hours seemed threatening
and full of menace. He might almost have
fancied he had dreamed the whole thing but for
the patrol on duty before the freight-house. At his
desk, he made out the detail of crews from among
the strike-breakers, using for this purpose the reports
which Mr. Round had secured of the past performances
and experience of the strangers. These
reports were anything but trustworthy, since they
had come from the men themselves, but they were
the only thing to be had, and he made up his lists
from them, giving the more important trains to the
men who seemed best fitted to handle them. One
thing made the task somewhat easier than it would
otherwise have been. He knew that for a few
days, at least, there would be no need to supply
the places of conductors and brakemen; only engineers
and firemen had to be provided now, but,
even at that, it was with no little uneasiness that he
finally passed the list over to his stenographer to
be copied.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first important train for which he must
supply a crew was Number Three, the west-bound
flyer, leaving Wadsworth at 2.30 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> As engineer,
he had selected a man named Hummel, who,
from the report, seemed to have had an exceptional
experience. But as the morning progressed, Allan
grew more and more uneasy over the prospect of
choosing the wrong man for this important post,
and finally decided to have a look at Hummel before
announcing the detail. So he called up the freight-house
and asked that that individual be sent over
to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Five minutes later, one of Stanley’s deputies
ushered into the chief dispatcher’s office a man
from whom Allan shrank instinctively as from a
serpent. He was a thin, undersized fellow, with
a face deeply pitted and with the ghastly pallour
which smallpox sometimes leaves behind it. But
it was not the complexion so much as the eyes which
disgusted and repelled. It is difficult to describe
the effect they produced—they were so venomous,
so bloodshot, so reptilian.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is your name Hummel?” Allan asked, speaking
with an effort not to show his repulsion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You seem to have had a good deal of experience.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ten years of it,” answered Hummel, confidently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What was the trouble?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What trouble?” demanded Hummel truculently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How does it come you’re here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! Well, I never got a square deal. I ain’t
no bootlicker I guess is the reason.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was already a trace of hostility in his tone,
as though he dimly felt the aversion his appearance
had occasioned.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” said Allan, “that’s all I want to
know. Thank you for coming over.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He turned back to his work, and Hummel, after
one venomous glance, stalked out the door. Allan
watched him and his guard as they crossed the
tracks toward the freight-house; then he reached
for his list and scratched out Hummel’s name.
But which name should be substituted? He hesitated
for a moment and then, snatching up his hat,
hastened over to the freight-house himself. Half
an hour later he returned, with some little information
as to the appearance of the owners of the
several names. Fully half of them he had checked
off as not to be sent out at all, unless it should
prove absolutely necessary. From the other half
he chose the men who would be needed during the
next twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the morning passed and noon came, and the
great division clock ticked off the seconds as calmly
as though this midday was just like any other.
To all appearances it was. The first train to start,
Number Four, the east-bound flyer, left Cincinnati
at 12.15, promptly on time. The regular engineer
had, of course, failed to report for duty, and when
a special man, convoyed by Mr. Schofield, climbed
up on the engine, the fireman, as Nixon had predicted,
climbed down. Another man was promptly
put in his place, and no further disaffection developed,
both conductor and brakeman remained on
duty, nor did any switchman attempt to interfere
with the train as it rolled slowly out of the yards
and on to the main track. Mr. Schofield had chosen
the best men at his command for this train, and as
it passed station after station on time, Allan’s spirits
rose perceptibly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other trains were started out without misadventure.
At Wadsworth, the strike-breakers were convoyed
to and from their trains by two of Stanley’s
men, the remainder patrolling the yards and keeping
them clear of loiterers. It was soon evident,
however, that ten men would not be enough to
handle this work night and day, and Allan instructed
Stanley to swear in ten more deputies.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the first afternoon passed and the first evening
came.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a raw and blustery night, very dark, with
dashes of sleet and snow, and, while everything
had passed off serenely without sign of trouble,
Allan was not wholly at ease as he left his office
and started home to supper. In fact, things were
<i>too</i> serene, and Allan could scarcely believe that
the strikers would permit their places to be filled
so quietly. Something of this apprehension must
have been apparent in his face, as he sat down to
supper, for Mamie, who was always quick to note
any change in him, looked at him anxiously and
started to ask a question, but thought better of it
and closed her lips again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re lookin’ real tired, Allan,” Mary observed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I <i>am</i> a little tired,” he admitted. “A good
supper will set me up again. Where’s Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He hasn’t come yet. Delayed out on the road
somewheres, I reckon. He’s mighty uncertain at
his meals since he got his promotion. Here he
comes now,” she added, as a heavy foot sounded
on the side porch, and the back door opened.</p>

<p class='c013'>They heard him moving around in the kitchen,
evidently washing up after the day’s work. Then
he opened the door and came into the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hello,” he said, nodding all around, and taking
his seat. “It’s a bad night for sure. How’s everything
goin’, Allan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, all right. We haven’t had a bit of trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I judged so,” said Jack, “from the way the
trains passed. I was over near Hamden lookin’
after that new switch. I don’t think there’ll be any
trouble among the section-men or switchmen,
either. They seem t’ think the thing’s a joke.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I don’t,” said Allan gloomily. “I think
it’s very different from a joke.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The responsibility of his position was beginning
to oppress him. Heretofore there had always
been somebody higher up with whom, in any unusual
emergency, he could consult. Now, he was
thrown entirely upon his own resources, and an
emergency might arise at any moment which might
involve much more than the welfare of the road.
Human life might be involved, and law and order—all
these might hinge upon a single word, the
decision of a moment. If only it might be given
him to speak the right word, to decide wisely! He
trembled inwardly at thought of the crisis he might
be called upon to face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got to go back,” he said, at last, pushing
back his chair. “I don’t know how long I’ll be,”
he added, “so don’t wait up for me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll go with you,” said Jack, catching a telegraphic
glance from Mamie and hastily gulping
down his coffee. “I want to take a look around
an’ see how things are.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” said Allan, “come along,” and together
they went out into the night.</p>

<p class='c013'>The wind had increased in violence and the
weather was turning much colder. They needed
all their breath, as they fought their way up the
street against the wind. At the freight-shed, Allan
paused for a word with one of the guards, who
was stamping his feet and clapping his arms against
his sides in an effort to keep warm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything all right?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir,” answered the guard, recognizing his
voice, “everything serene. Not a sign of trouble
anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s good,” said Allan, and started across the
yards.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m goin’ to look around a while,” said Jack.
“I’ll look you up in half an hour or so.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” said Allan, and continued on to his
office, while Jack’s figure vanished instantly in the
darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had turned back toward the freight-house,
intending to ask a few questions of the guard, but
as he passed the platform at the lower end, a voice
hailed him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That you, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Welsh answered, peering around, “but
where are you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Down here under the platform,” and as Jack
stooped, the odour of tobacco smoke assailed his
nostrils.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, is it you, Reddy?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes. Come under an’ set down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack groped his way under and, guided by the
glow of Reddy’s pipe, sat down beside him. The
quarters were rather cramped, but the cold wind
did not reach them and so they were fairly comfortable.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What you doin’ out here?” Jack demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh,” said Reddy, “I got so tired lookin’ at
them bums in there an’ listenin’ to their big mouths,
that I jest had t’ git away by myself an’ have a
quiet smoke. Did ye ever wash dishes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, once in a while,” Jack answered, laughing,
and getting out his pipe to keep Reddy company.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s a mighty poor way t’ earn a livin’,”
said the latter. “If it wasn’t fer Allan, I’d
a-thrown up the job afore I took it—but they’s
goin’ t’ be trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is? When?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Most any time. Them fellers can’t do without
whiskey any more’n you kin do without air.
They’re havin’ a meetin’ about it now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They are? What for?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They want t’ go an’ come as they please—between
the freight-house an’ them saloons over
there. They say they’re bein’ kept prisoners.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But that’s all nonsense!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t I know it,” said Reddy, scornfully, gazing
at the lighted windows across the yards which
marked the chief dispatcher’s office. “But any excuse’ll
do when a man’s lookin’ fer trouble. I guess
the strikers had a pointer this was comin’—that’s
the reason they’ve been so quiet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You mean you think there’s somebody tippin’
things off to them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; but I ain’t dead sure, yet,” answered
Reddy, knocking out his pipe. “Drop in here
every evenin’ an’ see me, Jack,” he added. “I’d
like t’ talk things over with ye. I must be gittin’
back. Hello, there goes the messenger,” he went
on, as a figure strode from the freight-shed across
the yards. “Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-night,” Jack answered, and he sat watching
the messenger. He saw him mount the stair
that led to the division offices, and, a few minutes
later, saw him come down again, accompanied by
Allan West. He watched them cross the yards
towards him, and mount the platform, heard a door
open and shut, and all was still.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I could only help!” he murmured to himself,
with drawn lips. “But I can’t—I can’t! An’
it’s a hard fight!”</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile, inside the freight-house a queer
scene was enacting. As must be the case when any
body of men are thrown together, a leader had
developed, or had arrogated to himself the rights
of leadership. In this instance, the leader, strangely
enough, was not one of the larger or older men,
but a small fellow whose livid pock-marked face
and shifty eyes told of life in city slums and not
in God’s open air—told, too, of a soul as well as
body infected—in a word, Hummel. The personnel
of the men had changed somewhat during
the afternoon. Ten or twelve crews had been sent
out, and as many had come in, but there was still
present a majority of those who had arrived the
night before. Hummel, of course, had been assigned
to no run, and those that remained with him
were the undesirables, the ones against whose
names Allan had placed a check-mark. Among
these, Hummel had been working quietly all day,
talking to them first singly, then in groups of two
and three, and finally, when they had finished supper,
he had spoken out boldly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know how you fellers feel about it,”
he said, getting to his feet and pounding on the
table to attract their attention, “but I feel a good
deal as though I was in a lock-up. Oh, I ain’t no
hypocrite—I knows how a lock-up feels, and I
guess I ain’t the only one here as does. But I didn’t
hire out to this here road t’ be locked up, an’ I won’t
stand it. This is a free country—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, see here, brother,” interposed Stanley,
who had come hurrying up, “you ain’t locked up,
an’ you know it. We’re treatin’ you right. We’re
givin’ you good grub an’ a good bed an’ we’ve got
a lookout jest to make sure you ain’t interfered
with.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You mean t’ say I kin go out that door if I
want to?” queried Hummel.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You sure can.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ come back if I want to?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said Stanley, sweetly. “You can’t come
back. If you go out, you lose your job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s it!” shouted Hummel, banging the
table again. “We kin go out, but we can’t come
back! Why can’t we come back?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’ll have to ask Mr. West,” replied Stanley.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who’s he?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s the chief dispatcher, and in charge
here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That kid what sent for me this mornin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The same. But he ain’t a kid an’ I’d advise
you not to monkey with him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pooh!” said Hummel, contemptuously. “I
guess I kin hold my own with a purty boy like that.
Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve sent for him. He’ll be here in a minute,”
and indeed, even as he spoke the words, Allan entered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hummel, thoroughly angry, looked Allan up and
down with a single glance of the eye, and continued
to stare at him impudently as he approached.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the trouble, Stanley?” Allan queried,
for he had heard Hummel’s excited voice as he
opened the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I guess this feller has gone without booze
about as long as he can stand it,” answered Stanley,
with a wave of his hand toward the white-faced
protestant. “He wants to go out an’ git some, I
reckon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s a lie!” shouted Hummel, waving his
arms in the air. “All I want is my rights as a
free American citizen. You can’t work no peonage
racket on me. You can’t keep me a prisoner—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nobody wants to,” broke in Allan. “Take
your coat and hat and get out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I will come back—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, you won’t—you’re fired. Get out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When do I get my wages?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Next payday—in about three weeks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s justice, ain’t it! I kin afford t’ loaf
around here three weeks, can’t I, t’ git one day’s
pay!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Leave your address and the check will be sent
you,” said Allan.</p>

<p class='c013'>But that was just what Hummel could not do, for
he had no idea where he would be in three weeks.
Besides, a glance around at the faces of his companions
showed him that he was going too fast—that
he had not secured their sympathy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” he said, after a moment, controlling
himself by a mighty effort. “I guess I kin stand
it awhile longer. I just wanted t’ be sure you
weren’t tryin’ to keep us prisoners. I’ll stay.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, you won’t,” retorted Allan, promptly.
“I’ve already told you you’re fired. Now get out,
or I’ll have Stanley throw you out. I guess you
can do it, can’t you, Stanley?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Try me,” said Stanley, grinning down from
his six feet upon the little man before him. “Say
the word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Hummel didn’t wait for that. With one
glance at the big officer, he turned to the wall and
took down his overcoat from a hook where he had
hung it. His face was livid and his lips were drawn
back from his yellow teeth in an ugly snarl, as he
started for the door. Stanley followed him and
gave the sentry outside word to pass him. Hummel
went down the steps silently, save for a queer hissing
in his throat, and Stanley stood and watched
him until he disappeared in the darkness. Then he
went slowly back into the freight-shed, his face
very grave.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That fellow means trouble,” he said to himself.
“He means trouble. Mebbe I’d ort to run him
in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Could he have seen Hummel at that moment, he
would have been more than ever convinced that he
was a dangerous man to be at large. For he had
stopped in the shadow of a box-car and waited until
Stanley, re-entering the building, closed the door
behind him. Then, creeping closer, he concealed
himself behind a pile of ties. There he sat down,
hugging his knees with his arms.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll git him,” he muttered, over and over to
himself. “I’ll git him. Oh, I’ll git him,” and he
sat staring at the freight-house door with eyes like
a wild beast’s.</p>

  <h2 id='ch17' class='c006'>CHAPTER XVII <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>EVENTS OF THE NIGHT</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>I<span class='sc'>nside</span> the freight-house, meanwhile, Allan had
called the men together and was giving them a
little talk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I want you men to understand,” he said, “that
you are in no sense confined here. You’re free to
go at any time. But if you do go, you can’t come
back. And I think all of you will understand the
necessity for that rule. We are keeping you here,
at considerable expense to ourselves, in order to
protect you from interference by the strikers. We
are trying to see that you are well fed and comfortably
lodged, and we are giving you this board
and lodging without charge. Of course, this isn’t
all pure philanthropy on our part. We are doing
it because we believe that it is only in this way
we can keep you together. If we permitted you
to board and lodge out in the town, we would never
know when you were going to show up for your
run. There would always be the danger that you
would be prevented from coming, either by force
or persuasion. It would be impossible for us to
run the road in that way. The only way we can
run it is to know certainly that you will be on hand
when needed, and the only way we can be certain
of that is to keep you together. When the strike
is ended, there will be no further need of doing
that, and a permanent place will be offered every
one of you who makes good. If there are any of
you who aren’t willing to work for the present
under those conditions, now is the time to say so.
If you want to quit, you are free to do so.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He looked around over the circle of faces, and
waited a moment to see if there was any response.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s fair enough,” said one of the men at
last. “I ain’t got no kick comin’,” and he walked
over toward his cot, and began to make preparations
to turn in. Two or three others followed his example,
and finally the whole group broke up
quietly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And <i>that’s</i> all right,” said Stanley, with a sigh
of relief. “I’m glad we got rid of that other duck.
He meant trouble—an’ he means it yet. You
look out for him, Mr. West.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” answered Allan, with a laugh. “I
guess I can look out for myself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’ll need an eye in the back of your head
t’ do it,” commented Stanley. “He’s the style that
hits from behind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll keep my eyes open—and you keep
yours open, too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Trust me for that,” said the detective. “Good
night, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-night,” said Allan and stepped out into
the darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>As his feet touched the platform outside the door
he felt that it was covered with sleet, and by the
glint of a distant street lamp, he could see that the
sleet was still falling. He hesitated an instant,
looking up and down the street.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bad night for railroading,” he said to himself.
“I guess I’d better see how things are going,” and
instead of descending the steps to the street, he followed
the platform around the building and started
across the tracks toward his office.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack Welsh, sitting under the platform where
Reddy had left him, smoked his pipe placidly and
stared out across the maze of tracks which separated
him from the depot building across the yards. A
sputtering arc light hung before the station, revealing
the groups of figures picking their way
carefully along the icy station platform. The rails
gleamed white with their coating of ice, and the
storm of sleet fell incessantly. Overhead Jack
could hear the burdened wires creaking under their
load of ice. Occasionally the yard engine came
slipping along, vomiting sand on both rails in its
effort to grip them, but freight was light, and
after awhile, its work ended for a time, it retired
to the lower yards, where it stood puffing on a
siding. The east-bound flyer, Number Two, was
past due, but its failure to arrive caused Jack no
uneasiness, for he knew that it was impossible for
any train to keep to its schedule on such a night.
Occasionally he heard overhead the tramp of the
guard going his rounds; far down the yards
gleamed the red and yellow lamps guarding the
switches; a switchman’s lantern waved from time
to time. Jack, sitting cosily in his shelter, watched
and understood and revelled in all this; for your
old railroad man—born and bred amid these surroundings—finds
his work grow more interesting,
more fascinating, from year to year, until any other
employment seems pale and savourless by comparison.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Welsh sat there musing, a quick step sounded
on the platform over his head, and a lithe figure
jumped to the ground and started across the tracks
toward the offices.</p>

<p class='c013'>“O’ course he’d be goin’ back there instead o’
goin’ home,” Jack muttered to himself. “Now,
what’d I better do? Hello, what’s that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He had caught the sound of a stealthy step overhead,
and an instant later, a slim form leaped to
the ground and sprang after Allan as swift and
noiseless as a panther.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a menace in that crouched figure
which brought Jack out from under the platform
with a jerk. Staring with startled eyes, he fancied
he caught a gleam as of a knife-blade in the air
and a warning cry leaped involuntarily to his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey, Allan. Look out!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Allan, starting sharp around at the cry,
found himself face to face with Hummel.</p>

<p class='c013'>The latter, stopping short in his swift career by
a mighty effort, stood for an instant, his face convulsed,
one hand behind him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what is it?” Allan asked, sharply, surveying
him with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I—I wanted t’ see you,” answered Hummel,
thickly. “I—I—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, go on,” said Allan, impatiently, as the
latter stopped.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was hurryin’,” Hummel gasped. “I’m out
o’ breath. I wants me job back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You can’t have it. Now get out of these yards.
If I catch you here again, I’ll have you run in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Hummel’s face flushed, and he made a convulsive
movement forward, but stopped, as he heard
rapid steps drawing near.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, was it you who shouted, Jack?” asked
Allan, in surprise, as the latter came running up.
“What was the matter?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I seen this feller sneakin’ acrost the yards after
you,” Jack explained, apologetically, “an’ I thought
he meant trouble. I didn’t know he was a friend
o’ yours.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I jest wanted t’ speak t’ him,” said Hummel,
gruffly, and started to turn away.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Jack caught him by the arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wait a minute,” he said. “Let’s look into
this. Is he a friend o’ yours?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” Allan answered. “Quite the contrary.
He’s a fellow I fired a while ago.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh,” said Jack, and looked at Hummel more
closely. “What’re ye holdin’ one hand behind
your back for?” he demanded. “Let’s see it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>He grabbed at the hidden hand, but at the same
instant Hummel, supple as an eel, slipped from his
grasp, ducked, and sped down the yards like a
shadow.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and Allan stood for an instant staring after
him. Then the former, with a sudden exclamation,
raised his hand and looked at it. It was covered
with blood.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thought so!” he cried. “He had a knife!
I saw it when he was runnin’ after you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you hurt?” and Allan, snatching out his
handkerchief, wiped away the blood.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Only a scratch. The knife got me when I
grabbed at him. It’s nothin’. You go ahead, an’
I’ll see if I can find him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan, examining the wound, saw that it was
not a deep one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” he said, wrapping his handkerchief
about it. “I’ll wait for you at the office.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack nodded and hastened away down the yards
in the direction Hummel had taken. But search
as he might, he found no trace of that worthy, who
had dived in among a lot of box cars stored on the
sidings, and made good his escape.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Allan, meanwhile, continued on to his office, and
sat thoughtfully down before his desk. The incident
of the evening, his own narrow escape, enlightened
him as to the danger of the situation.
Calm as it appeared on the surface, it was perilous
enough underneath, like a vast bed of lava, apparently
cool and firm, but ready, at any pin-prick,
to burst forth into white-hot flame. He shivered
a little at thought of the days to follow and the
problems they would present.</p>

<p class='c013'>But after a moment he shook such thoughts impatiently
away. Time enough to cross a bridge
when he came to it. Now there were other matters
demanding his attention. For, as the night progressed,
the load of sleet burdened the wires more
and more heavily, until some gave way and the
others sputtered and stuttered and sent operators
and dispatchers alike to the verge of frenzy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nothing disorganizes a railroad more quickly
than impeded or inefficient wires, for the reason
that its operation depends wholly upon its telegraph
system. To interfere with that means inevitably
to interfere with traffic, to obstruct it is to obstruct
traffic, and to stop it is to stop traffic, or to compel
it, at best, to creep painfully along from station
to station with one flagman walking in front of
every train and another following it a hundred
yards in the rear. It may be added that it was the
telegraph which made modern railroading possible;
and that it becomes impossible at the moment when
the dispatcher at headquarters cannot, in some way,
keep informed of the position of every train.</p>

<p class='c013'>So to-night with the wires chattering unintelligible
nonsense instead of the usual crisp orders
and reports, operators and dispatchers were at their
wits’ ends, traffic was delayed, the schedule abandoned
and the only hope was that some way, somehow,
they would get through the night without
accident.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan stood for a moment at the door of the
dispatchers’ office listening to the crazy instruments.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve only got one wire left,” announced the
dispatcher in charge of the Parkersburg division,
“and I might as well try to send a message over
a piece of clothes line as over it. I haven’t any idea
where that extra west is. It left Vigo half an hour
ago, and hasn’t been seen since.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where’s Number Two?” asked Allan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Number Two will be here in four or five minutes,”
answered the other dispatcher.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And that freight ought to have been here ten
minutes ago!” wailed the first speaker. “Oh, its
enough to drive a man crazy,” and he went on
calling Schooley’s.</p>

<p class='c013'>The east bound flyer could not, of course, be permitted
to leave Wadsworth until the west-bound
freight had pulled in, or had been definitely located.
It was lost as completely as though it had wandered
away to the farthest corner of the globe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan stood for a moment with a line of perplexity
between his eyebrows. Then he looked up
with a sudden interest as he heard the faint click-click,
click-click which told that the operator at
Schooley’s had answered at last.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about extra west?” clicked the dispatcher.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Passed here at 9.22,” came the answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan glanced at the clock. It was 9.47; in other
words, the train had passed Schooley’s twenty-five
minutes previously, and Schooley’s was only seven
miles out. That seven miles should have been covered
in fifteen minutes at the outside. What, then,
had happened to delay the train?</p>

<p class='c013'>A long whistle in the distance told of the approach
of the flyer, and a minute later, it rumbled
into the station and came wheezing to a stop. The
train would stop for five minutes to change engines.
That it should be held up longer than that by a
freight train was heartrending. It was over half
an hour late already, and Allan had hoped that some
of this lost time might be made up on the run east
to Parkersburg.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s only one thing to be done,” he said,
“and that’s to flag out till we find that freight
train,” and he hurried down the stairs to give the
necessary orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>Already the new engine had been backed up and
coupled onto the train. Engineer and fireman were
in their places, having been convoyed safely across
the yards by two of Stanley’s men, who remained
in the cab to see that they were not interfered with
until the train should pull out.</p>

<div id='p196'  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/p196.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>“HE EXPLAINED THE DIFFICULTY TO THE ENGINEER.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>At the foot of the stairs, Allan met the conductor,
Andy Leaveland, one of the oldest on the
road. He was on his way up to register and get
his orders, when Allan stopped him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got the orders, Mr. Leaveland,” he said.
“We’ll have to flag out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Flag</i> out!” cried the veteran. “What’s the
matter? Wires down?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a freight lost somewhere between here
and Schooley’s. We’ve got to find it. You’d better
start your brakeman out right away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” said Leaveland, and hurried away,
while Allan walked forward to the engine.</p>

<p class='c013'>He explained the difficulty to the engineer, and
a minute later, the brakeman, armed with lantern,
torpedoes and fusee, hurried past. Leaveland gave
him time to get two or three hundred yards ahead,
and then gave the signal to start.</p>

<p class='c013'>The train crawled slowly out through the yards,
past the shops and the great coal chute, and finally
emerged upon the main track. Far ahead, Allan
could see the brakeman’s lantern bobbing along.
The ice on the track rendered rapid walking impossible
and more than once, the train was brought to
a stop to give the brakeman a chance to maintain
his distance. Back in the coaches, the passengers
were fuming and fretting, while the conductor was
doing his best to pacify them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re going mighty slow,” he said. “Most
roads would go faster. But this road don’t take
any chances. We won’t get you through on time,
but we’ll get you through safe and sound, without
the slightest chance of accident. I guess if we put
it to a vote, most of you would vote for safety
rather than speed,” and he looked around at the
passengers with a smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You bet we would,” assented one of the men,
and there was less grumbling after that.</p>

<p class='c013'>And yet there are few things more trying to the
nerves than to ride in a train which may proceed
no faster than a man can walk. An hour was consumed
in covering five miles, and not a trace of the
missing freight had been discovered. Another mile—and
then Allan, staring forward through the
night, saw the brakeman’s lantern waving violently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s found something,” he said, and the engineer
nodded.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next moment, a fusee flared redly through
the darkness, lighting up the brakeman—and
something on the track back of him—a dim
shape—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, it’s the train!” cried Allan. “And with
its headlight out! And with no brakeman out to
protect it! I don’t understand it!” And he sat
with his brows knitted in thought as the train
rolled slowly forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>It stopped within thirty feet of the other train,
and Allan swung himself to the ground and ran
forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s happened?” he asked the brakeman,
who came to meet him. “Where’s the crew?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blamed if I know,” answered the brakeman,
in an awed voice. “There’s the train, but nary
a trace of her crew could I find. She’s deserted!”</p>

yet still, by some miracle, keeping afloat. Every
one of them tells of some tragedy of the sea—of
some supreme moment of peril, when, thinking
the end at hand, the crew has taken to the boats
and left their ship to its fate. And there is no
peril of the deep more dreaded by mariners, for it
is one that can not be foreseen nor guarded against.
Lying low in the waves, heavy and water-logged,
these hulks drift down upon a ship unseen in the
watches of the night; there is a crash, a rush of
water—and another tragedy has been enacted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another tragedy which, only a few short years
ago, too frequently meant the loss of the ship and
every soul on board. How often has some stately
vessel, thronged with happy people, set sail from a
crowded harbour over a fair summer sea, upon a
voyage seemingly certain to prove prosperous and
pleasant—never to be seen again! How agonized
those first days of uncertainty when the ship did
not appear at the port for which it had set sail.
Days passed, and still no word from it; days and
days, during which hope changed to doubt and
doubt to despair; days and days, until finally men
knew that it would never appear—that it had vanished
into the deep—that it had struck an iceberg
or a derelict and sunk with all on board.</p>

<p class='c013'>But science, with its giant strides, has changed
all that. The ship may go down, but at least she
can give warning of her danger. For in a little
cubby-hole on the upper deck, his hand upon his
instrument, sits the wireless operator, flashing to
the four winds of heaven the “C. Q. D., C. Q. D.,”
which tells of deadly peril and the need of instant
aid. And every ship within a hundred miles, catching
that signal, turns in her tracks and speeds, full
steam ahead, to render what aid she can. Truly,
a fearful and wonderful thing, this wireless, with
its slender filaments and lofty masts and bursts of
ether-compelling flame, yoking to man’s service
something more impalpable than the air itself, binding
ocean to ocean around the whole face of the
earth. An accident may happen—that ship may
go down—the derelict may do its deadly work—but
at least the world will know. And if there is
any vessel within reaching distance, the passengers
will be saved! Ill-fated <i>Bourgogne</i>, slowly settling
beneath the icy waters off the Grand Banks, with
aid just beyond the horizon, but all unconscious
of her desperate need; ill-fated <i>Naronic</i>, lost with
all on board, how or where for all time unsolved
and unsolvable; ill-fated <i>Republic</i>, sending forth
her cry for aid through the night and through the
fog, lost, indeed, but with every living soul saved
uninjured—a new tale and a new wonder on history’s
page!</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>But here was a derelict of a new kind—a derelict
on land—no less deadly than the derelict on
sea; standing four-square in the way of traffic, a
threat and a mystery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some such thought as this ran through Allan’s
mind, as he stood for an instant staring in astonishment
at the deserted train. Why was it here?
Why had it been abandoned? What stress of peril
was it had compelled its crew to leave it? What
peril could there be to drive them not only from
the train, but from the neighbourhood? The question
staggered the reason. Above all, why had its
headlight been extinguished? That seemed to
argue design—seemed to argue malicious intent—seemed
to argue that the missing crew were
deserters, traitors—as much a traitor as the soldier
who deserts in the face of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then, as the steam popped off from the abandoned
locomotive, he awoke with a start to the
necessity for instant action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ve got to get that train in on a siding,”
he said to the brakeman. “We’ll have to back up
to Schooley’s. It’s only a mile. Ask Leaveland
and his engineer to come here right away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As the fireman hurried away, Allan ran forward
and swung himself up into the cab of the deserted
engine. He glanced at the water gauge and saw
that there was plenty of water in the boiler, but he
opened the door of the fire-box as an extra precaution.
Evidently the engine had been abandoned
only a short time before, for the fire was burning
briskly. He saw that the brakes had been applied
and the throttle closed—</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the matter?” asked Leaveland’s voice.
“Is this the train?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, this is the train, all right,” Allan answered,
“but I don’t see anything of the crew.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll be hanged!” and Leaveland scratched
his head in perplexity. “What do you suppose
happened?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know. Let’s take a look at the caboose,”
and jumping to the ground, he started back
along the train.</p>

<p class='c013'>The door of the caboose was swinging open,
and a glare of yellow light came through it from
the oil lamp, with polished tin reflector back of it,
which was attached to the front wall. Allan sprang
up the steps, with Leaveland after him, and both
of them stopped in astonishment at the open door.
The caboose was empty, but two stools stood on the
floor before the stove, and between them a box on
which was a checker-board and checkers. Evidently
the conductor and rear brakeman had been
playing together, but had been interrupted in their
game and had left the board just as it was, expecting
to return to it. They had not returned,
however, but had vanished as completely as though
the earth had opened and swallowed them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll be hanged!” said Leaveland again.
“There’s something mighty queer about this. If I
believed in ghosts, now—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I don’t think it’s ghosts,” laughed Allan.
“But we can’t stop to investigate. We’d better
couple the two engines together, and let Number
Two push this train back to Schooley’s. You go
ahead and have that done, and I’ll stay here. I’ll
burn a fusee if I want you to stop, but I don’t think
there’s any danger, because nothing will get past
Schooley’s till this train has been accounted for.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, sir,” assented Leaveland, and hurried
back toward the engine.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan, left to himself, made a careful inspection
of the caboose, but search as he might, he could
find nothing that shed the slightest light upon the
disappearance of the train crew. It was evident
that there had been no struggle of any kind. He
found the conductor’s report made up ready to turn
in at the end of the trip, and his lantern and dinner-pail
on the floor near the door. The more he examined
the surroundings the plainer it was that
when the conductor and brakeman left the caboose,
they had expected to return to it in a minute or
two. And that they had left it only a short time
before was evident from the fact that the fire in
their stove had just been renewed and was burning
briskly.</p>

<p class='c013'>He gave up the problem, at last, and getting a
fusee out of the box where they were kept, he
stepped out upon the rear platform. As he did so,
he heard the cars of the train buckling toward him,
and an instant later the caboose caught the motion
and started slowly up the track toward Schooley’s.
The mile was soon covered, and the train, coming
to a stop just outside the little town, was run in
on a siding, while the flyer proceeded on to the
station. There Allan reported it, secured orders
for it, and sent it on its way. Then he proceeded
to try to solve the mystery of the abandoned freight
train.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there was little or nothing to be learned concerning
it more than he already knew. It had
passed through Schooley’s without stopping, and
the operator there had observed nothing wrong with
it. After half an hour’s inquiry, Allan gave it up,
ordered another crew sent out from Wadsworth,
and finally, after reporting the occurrence to Stanley,
turned in at his own gate about midnight, very
tired and not a little worried.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he entered the house, he was surprised to see
a light burning in the dining-room, and he opened
the door softly and looked in. For a moment, he
saw no one, and thinking that the room was empty
and that the light had simply been left burning for
him, he was about to turn it out, when his eyes fell
upon a figure curled up on the lounge which stood
against the wall under the windows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, it’s Mamie!” he said, half to himself,
and took a step toward her. “I wonder—”</p>

<p class='c013'>And then he stopped suddenly, for, awakened by
the noise of his entrance or by the consciousness
of his presence, she opened her eyes and looked at
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a moment, she lay so, looking up, her lips
parted in a smile. Then, with a quick movement,
she brushed her hand over her eyes and sat
upright, her cheeks crimson with a strange confusion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, Allan!” she cried. “Do you know, I—I
must have been asleep!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” he agreed, laughing. “I don’t think
there’s any doubt of it. Since when have you
taken to sleeping on this lounge?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wasn’t at all sleepy to-night,” Mamie explained,
“and I knew it wasn’t any use to go to
bed, so I thought I’d read awhile till I got sleepy
or till you—till you—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Or till I got home,” said Allan, finishing the
sentence for her. “Admit, Mamie, that you were
sitting up for me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I was!” confessed the girl, raising her
eyes for one swift glance at him. “Dad came
home and told about that horrid man trying to kill
you, and I—I just couldn’t stand it to go to bed
without seeing you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan took a quick turn up and down the room.
That shy and timorous glance had moved him
strangely, as did the faltering words which followed
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suppose he had killed you!” she added, with
a little gasp of horror at the thought.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But he didn’t,” said Allan, coming back to her.
“So what’s the use of supposing anything of the
sort?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dad says he’ll be sure to try it again. Dad
says—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dad says altogether too much,” broke in Allan.
“Now, see here, Mamie, I’m not going to have
you worried like this. Wait till I see your father!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, but I want him to tell me! If you’re in
danger, I want to know it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I’m not in any danger—as for that affair
with Hummel, it happened so long ago that I’d
nearly forgotten it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So long ago!” cried Mamie. “Why, it was
only this evening!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, so much has happened since. Mamie,
I’m worried to death,” he added, with sudden weakness.
“The queerest thing happened to-night you
ever heard of.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell me about it,” said Mamie, her face glowing
with pleasure at this call for sympathy and
help; and she patted the lounge invitingly. I fear
there was some instinct of the coquette in Mamie,
or she would not have done that! Some true
womanly instinct, too, or she would not have so
welcomed this chance to be of help.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan sat down, his pulses not wholly steady,
and told of the strange disappearance of the crew
of the extra west, while Mamie listened spell-bound.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if that doesn’t beat anything I ever
heard!” she cried, when he had finished. “What
do you suppose happened?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I haven’t any idea. Only I’m sure the strikers
must have had something to do with it. I’m
going to take Stanley out to look the place over in
the morning. Maybe we’ll discover something.
Stanley is pretty shrewd, you know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But if the strikers had something to do with
it,” Mamie protested, “maybe they will be there
yet! And you will walk right into them!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well?” laughed Allan. “What if I do? Indeed,
I hope I will!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, but think what they will do to you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They won’t do anything very bad! We’re
not living in the Middle Ages, Mamie. I believe
you think we’re going to find the bloody corpses of
that train crew out there in a ditch, somewhere!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But if they aren’t dead, where are they?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kidnapped. The strikers are taking that
method of getting our men away from us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mamie thought it over a minute, and then shook
her head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Maybe you’re right,” she said, “but it seems
to me that the strikers would be pretty foolish to
do anything like that. Suppose they do take a
crew, that won’t matter much, will it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; not one crew; but suppose they keep on
taking them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mamie stared at him with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you mean that’s what you think they’ll
do?” she questioned.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know—it’s a thought that came to
me. But it seems foolish, too. Well, we’ll find out
in the morning. And now you must be getting to
bed. How about the beauty sleep?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Beauty sleep, indeed!” cried Mamie, tossing
her head. “I don’t need any beauty sleep!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, you don’t!” agreed Allan, gazing at the
piquant face. “Do you know, Mamie, you’re
growing up into the prettiest girl imaginable!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Growing up!” echoed Mamie. “I’ve grown
up! Why, I’m nearly seventeen!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A tremendous age!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Old enough to know you’re talking nonsense!”
she retorted, but with the colour coming and going
in her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m not!” he protested. “It’s true! If I was
younger, Mamie, I’d be falling in love with you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Younger!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m twenty-seven.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A tremendous age!” she echoed, glancing up
at him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ten years older than you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pooh! What’s ten years?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s a good deal,” said Allan, rising with
an effort. “And I feel considerably older than
twenty-seven to-night—more like forty! You can
keep on sitting up, if you want to, but I’m going
to bed. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mamie had risen too, a strange light in her eyes.
She watched him as he turned away, and then,
when his hand was on the knob of the door, she
called him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Allan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?” he said, turning and looking at her.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lamplight sent little mocking shadows across
her face and brought out the glint of gold in her
hair. He held on to the door-knob to keep from
going back to her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Promise me you’ll not run into any danger,”
she said, softly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course I won’t—not unless I have to.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not even if you have to!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What—run away?” he demanded, staring at
her in astonishment. “You wouldn’t have me do
that, Mamie?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” she said, “I wouldn’t have you do that!
Good-night, Allan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-night,” he repeated, and opened the door
and went resolutely up the stair to his room.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Mamie, standing listening until the sound
of his steps died away, at last flung herself down
upon the lounge and buried her face in her arms.
Her eyes were wet with tears—but they were tears
of joy.</p>

  <h2 id='ch19' class='c006'>CHAPTER XIX <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>THE OLD STONE HOUSE</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>I<span class='sc'>t</span> is doubtful if any sensation had ever stirred
the staid little town of Wadsworth from centre to
circumference as did the news to which it awoke
next morning. The story of the missing train
crew, of the mysteriously abandoned train, flew
from mouth to mouth, gaining always in the telling
some thrilling detail, the generally accepted
version being that the strikers had wrecked the
train and butchered the crew, the conductor and
brakeman perishing in trying to protect the “scab”
engineer and fireman. There was no one to worry
especially about the latter, for they were strangers
whose names were not even known, but the conductor
and the two brakemen all had families, to
say nothing of relatives and friends, and all of
these were very properly exercised.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan, foreseeing this excitement, reached his
office almost at daybreak, but early as it was, he
found three excited women awaiting him, demanding
information, hope, encouragement. Of information
he had little to give, but of hope and encouragement
a-plenty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s absolutely no reason why you should
be so worried,” he told them, when he got them
into his office and the door closed. “Your husbands
haven’t been injured in any way—I’m sure
of it. They’ll be back safe and sound in a day or
two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What makes you think they haven’t been
hurt?” demanded one of the women. “You don’t
really know, do you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I don’t really know. But it’s absurd to
believe anything else.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But who did it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you suspect! Oh, if I thought it was the
strikers, I’d—I’d tear their eyes out!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And the other two women added that they would
be glad to help.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, see here,” broke in Allan, realizing that
forceful measures were necessary, “we mustn’t
have any nonsense of that sort. I don’t know
whether it was the strikers or not—there’s nothing
to show it was. If it was, they’ll be punished—trust
me for that. If it wasn’t, let’s not accuse
them. I want you to promise to leave this thing
in my hands. We’re going to do everything possible
to clear it up. I want you to promise me to
go home and stay there and not do any talking for
forty-eight hours.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And if we do, what will you promise?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan hesitated an instant.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll promise,” he said, drawing a deep breath,
“that in forty-eight hours the men will be back
again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They gazed at him a moment—at the clear eyes,
the firm lips, the determined jaw—and something
of his self-confidence communicated itself to them.
And they promised and left the office in much better
spirits than when they had entered it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Almost before the door closed after them, Allan
had summoned Stanley, and while waiting for that
worthy to appear, gave orders that no information
concerning the mystery, or concerning anything
else connected with the strike should be given out
by anyone but himself. He wanted to be left free,
for a few hours, at least, to work on the case in his
own way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stanley, evidently knowing what was in the
wind, lost no time in obeying the summons. Allan
told him, briefly, the story of the mystery, and laid
before him the theory which he had mentioned to
Mamie the night before—that this was only a
preliminary move on the part of the strikers. Stanley
listened in silence, and sat for a moment thinking
it over when Allan had finished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know,” he said, at last. “I can’t say
I think much of your theory. It looks to me like a
mighty bold thing for the strikers to do—an’
what’s worse, a mighty foolish one. They can’t
hope to capture enough men to really cripple us.
Where would they keep them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m sure I don’t know. But what other explanation
can there be?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Stanley, “I’m always in favour of
the simplest explanation. Maybe the whole thing
was just a plain robbery. Were the car seals examined
after the train got in?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—I’d thought of that. None of the seals
were broken.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It ain’t so much of a trick t’ doctor a seal, if
a feller’s fixed for it,” Stanley observed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But suppose it was a robbery—where is the
crew? Nobody would want to steal them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d like to look over the ground before I do
any more guessing,” said Stanley. “Why can’t
I run out there? Everything’s quiet here and I
can be back by night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what I was thinking of,” agreed Allan.
“And I’m going with you. We can take the accommodation—I’ll
get the conductor to drop us
off at the place we found the train.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” said Stanley, rising. “I’ll just run
over to the freight-house an’ give my men a few
orders. I’ll be back in five minutes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ve got fifteen,” said Allan, glancing at his
watch. “I’ll meet you down on the platform.”
Then he called the office-boy from the outer room.
“Jim,” he said, “I’m going to be busy for a while
and don’t want to be disturbed. See that I’m
not.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, sir,” said Jim, and retired to take
his stand before the door, like Cerberus before the
gate of Hades.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the next ten minutes, Allan devoted his
whole mind to clearing away the accumulated work
which piled his desk. Fortunately, he had an intelligent
and efficient stenographer, and tossed the
last letter to him just as the accommodation pulled
in.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all,” he said. “I’m going out to
Schooley’s. You can catch me there, if you need
me, but I’ll probably be back by the middle of the
afternoon. Hello!” he added, as he reached for
coat and hat, “what’s all that noise?”</p>

<p class='c013'>And, indeed, from the sounds, it seemed that a
riot of some sort was taking place in the outer
office.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan flung open the door, and paused, amazed,
on the threshold. For a dozen men rushed at him
with a violence which almost carried him off his
feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here; hold on!” he shouted. “What’s the
matter with you fellows, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We want to know—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everybody says see you—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We must have the story—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, reporters!” cried Allan, suddenly understanding.
“I can’t give you anything now, boys;
I’ve got to catch a train. I’ll give you the whole
story as soon as I get back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When will that be?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sometime this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, look here,” began one of the men desperately;
but Allan tore his way through and sprang
down the steps two at a time.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the foot, another man was waiting for him,
and Allan recognized the special delegate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Mr. West,” he began, excitedly, “I
understand the Brotherhood’s accused of having a
hand in this thing, and I just want to say to you
that it didn’t—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” said Allan, and swung himself
on to the rear platform of the train. “I’ll be back
this afternoon. Drop in and talk it over.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will. There isn’t a bit of truth in the—”</p>

<p class='c013'>But the delegate’s voice was drowned by the
rumble of the train as it started.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan, entering the coach, found Stanley awaiting
him. They dropped into a seat together.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, did they get you?” asked the detective,
grinning.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I managed to break away. But I nearly missed
the train. Then that fellow in charge of the strike
held me up to say the Brotherhood hadn’t anything
to do with this thing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no,” said Stanley, “of course the Brotherhood
didn’t. But that isn’t saying that none of its
members did.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The conductor came up at that moment and
stopped for a moment’s chat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We want to drop off about a mile and a half
this side of Schooley’s,” said Allan. “I’ll show
you the place.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right. Going out to look over the
ground?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; and to solve the riddle if we can. By
the way, I’m glad to see the conductors and brakemen
still at work. I hope you’re going to stick.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” answered the other, “we had a meeting
last night, but of course I can’t tell you what happened
there. I can say this, though—you don’t
need to lose any sleep over it yet awhile.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s good,” said Allan, his cheeks flushing
with pleasure. “Here we are!” he added, as he
glanced out the window.</p>

<p class='c013'>The conductor pulled the signal cord sharply
and Allan and Stanley dropped off as the train’s
speed slackened. Then the conductor gave the go-ahead
signal, and the train sped eastward on its
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had been carried a little past the place
where the derelict had been discovered. Allan led
the way back, pointed out the spot, as nearly as he
could—very nearly, however, for he found the
fusee which the fireman had burnt—and then sat
down on the bank beside the roadway, while Stanley
prowled up and down like some sort of wild
beast. His great hooked nose seemed to grow
longer and more hooked, and his little close-set eyes
sparkled with a strange brilliancy. For Stanley was
really a man of considerable ability and had been
successful in clearing up more than one abstruse
problem. Allan watched him with a good deal of
curiosity, and the thought came to him that he
would not care to have this fellow on his trail.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can’t make much out of it,” Stanley said at
last, stopping before Allan. “Let’s look around
the neighbourhood a little.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The track, at this point, ran along a shallow cut,
the bank on either side rising to a height of two or
three feet. The right of way, about twenty-five
feet in width, was bordered by rail fences, and back
of them was a stretch of scrubby woodland. Stanley,
walking slowly along the bank on the left,
stopped suddenly and pointed to the ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look at that,” he said. “There’s been a
wagon here. Two wagons,” he added, a moment
later, pointing to other traces.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To take the prisoners away in,” ventured Allan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Maybe, maybe,” muttered his companion.
“And maybe to take something else away in. Let’s
see where they went.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The tracks could be followed without difficulty
in the soft earth. They led to a break in one of the
fences and on through the strip of woodland to a
road on the farther side. There they turned westward
and were lost amid the ruts of the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Stanley, stopping and looking
along it, “I think, if you don’t mind, that I’d like
to spend a day or two trying to run those fellows
down. I don’t see that I’m needed back at Wadsworth—everything’s
quiet there, and my men
know their business. Besides, you can keep an eye
on them. This affair kind of worries me. There’s
more in it than appears on the surface. What do
you say?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” Allan agreed. “I’d like to have
this thing cleared up. Do you think you can do
it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can try, anyway,” said Stanley. “And I’ll
start right away. I don’t want the trail to get any
colder. Good by.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good by,” said Allan; “and good luck.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He stood watching Stanley’s gaunt figure until
it disappeared around a turn in the road, wishing
absurdly that he could go along; then he turned
eastward toward the little station of Schooley’s, a
mile or more away. The road was one evidently
not much used, for it was rutted and uneven and in
poor repair. The fall and winter rains had washed
it badly, and evidently no effort had been made to
repair it. In fact, it soon grew so bad that Allan
began to doubt whether it was anything more than
a private road. The trees on either side grew
closer and closer to it, there was no vestige of a
fence, and after a time it became apparent that its
direction had changed so that it was not leading
him toward Schooley’s at all. A glance at the sun
showed him that it was past midday, and his stomach
began to warn him that he had eaten nothing
since breakfast early that morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>He stopped for a moment in perplexity and considered
what he would better do. He might strike
off into the woods in the direction in which he
thought Schooley’s to be, but he was by no means
certain of the direction, and the most probable result
of such a course would be to get lost and miss his
way entirely. The road he was following must certainly
lead to a house; there were wagon tracks
and hoof-prints on it which seemed fresh, so he
concluded that the best thing he could do was to
push forward as rapidly as possible, find the house
to which the road led, and then, if he was any considerable
distance from Schooley’s, hire a vehicle of
some sort to take him on to his destination.</p>

<p class='c013'>He walked on more rapidly, after that, following
the road as it turned and twisted among the trees.
The ground grew uneven and at last actually hilly,
and the road grew worse and worse. Allan began
to fear that it led only to a wood-lot or outlying
field, and was more than once tempted to turn back,
seek the railroad track and follow it into Schooley’s.
But always he resolved to go around the next corner
and the next, and finally his perseverance was rewarded.</p>

<p class='c013'>For there, almost hidden behind a screen of trees,
with hills protecting it on either side, stood an old
stone house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Heartened by this discovery, Allan hurried forward,
and yet, as he drew near, he hesitated, for
there was about the place something indescribably
desolate and dreary—something almost threatening.
The windows across the front of the house
were all closed by heavy shutters. There were five
of them, one on either side of the door in the lower
story, and three in the story above. The house was
square and solidly built, but had fallen into neglect
and decay. The roof was covered with moss, and
the path to the front door broken and uneven.
There was a tumble-down barn some distance back
of it and one or two other decrepit outbuildings,
from which, however, came no sign of life.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan, for a moment, thought the house deserted,
too; then his eyes caught a faint streamer of smoke
which drifted sluggishly upward from one of the
chimneys, and, encouraged by this sign of human
occupancy, he hastened forward and knocked at the
front door.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no response, and he knocked again
more loudly. Still there was no response, though
he fancied that he detected a sort of uneasy movement
inside the house, as though some one were
moving cautiously along the hall, and he had a sensation
as though some one was staring out at him.
It was a sensation anything but pleasant, as every
one who has experienced it knows, and it required
no little resolution for him to carry his quest
further. But he resolutely shook away the feeling
of uneasiness, and, leaving the front door, he proceeded
around the house, determined to try a door
at the back. He knew that there was some one in
the house and he determined to have him out.</p>

<p class='c013'>He found the rear of the house even more dilapidated
and forbidding than the front. A ramshackle
porch ran across the back, in the last stages of decay,
its floor rotted through and its roof falling in.
Near by was an old pump which had evidently
yielded no water for many years. This did not
seem to indicate that the house was occupied, but
Allan picked his way carefully across the porch,
and knocked at the back door. Again there was
silence. He banged with his closed fist, and when
there was no response, he tried the door, rattling
the knob fiercely. But the door was locked. And
then, suddenly, it seemed to him that he could hear
a confused sound of voices, faint and far-away.
He listened intently, and banged the door again,
and again there came that confused murmur. After
all it might be only an echo, Allan told himself; no
doubt the house was cavernous and empty, and
would re-echo strangely to any sound. Or the house
might be full of bats—or some strange creature
might have its dwelling place there.</p>

<p class='c013'>He crossed the porch again and breathed a little
easier as he stood once more in the open air.
Plainly, there was nothing for him to do but retrace
his steps to the railroad and follow it in to Schooley’s.
He sighed at thought of the weary way he
had to go.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll have a look at the barn, first,” he murmured
to himself, and started toward it.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was perhaps a hundred feet back of the house,
and leaned so dangerously to one side that it seemed
in danger of falling at any moment. There were
two doors, a large one running upon an overhead
rail, and a smaller one swinging upon hinges. He
tried the smaller one first, and found that it yielded
to his touch. Swinging it open, he stepped inside
the barn.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hello!” he called. “Is there any one here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no response, but he fancied that he
heard a faint rustling at the farther end of the
structure. For a moment, in the semi-darkness, he
could see nothing, then, as his eyes grew more accustomed
to it, he saw that the place was empty.
The stalls on either side had fallen to decay, the
roof had rotted away in places and the floor was
wet and mucky and covered with an ill-smelling
litter. There had at one time been a loft, but the
planks which had composed the flooring had disappeared,
stolen no doubt by some one in the neighbourhood.
Only at the farther end did he find any
indication of recent occupancy. Here in the mangers
were some fresh cobs from which the corn had
evidently been eaten only a short time before, and
the floor was covered with a litter of straw, which
was tramped and soiled, indeed, but which was still
comparatively clean. Farther on, two boards had
been laid across a manger and piled with straw,
which was pressed down as though it had been used
for a bed. It was from this, Allan concluded, that
the rustling had proceeded, doubtless from some
rats running through it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Satisfied that it was useless to look further, Allan
turned back toward the door. He was tired and
discouraged. He felt that the day had been wasted.
The mystery of the abandoned train was no nearer
solution than it had been, unless Stanley—</p>

<p class='c013'>What was it sent a sudden chill through him?
What was it brought him with a start out of this
reverie?</p>

<p class='c013'>He turned his head with a jerk and threw up his
arm instinctively, as a dark shadow seemed to loom
over him; then a great blow fell upon his head, the
world reeled and turned black before him, and he
fell forward limply upon his face.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c006'>CHAPTER XX <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>THE AWAKENING</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>A<span class='sc'>t</span> Wadsworth, the day had passed quietly
enough, so far, at least, as appearances went. The
strikers gathered in groups in the neighbourhood of
the station, and watched the trains go in and out,
with the new engineers and firemen in the cabs,
but they made no attempt to interfere with them,
beyond an occasional jeer. Simpson, the special
delegate from the grand lodge, had established his
headquarters in the lodge room, and a little group
of men was constantly about him, talking over the
situation. It was noticeable that this group was
composed of the older and more experienced men,
and it was evident that whatever Simpson had to
say had a great deal of weight with them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simpson, as has been said, was a very different
man from Nixon. There was nothing flashy or
loud about him, his voice was low, but cool and
decisive, and his gray eyes gave one the impression
that their owner was a fighter—an impression
which was further deepened by the long, cloven
chin. In a word, the grand secretary had picked
out the very best man at his disposal when the demand
had come for a delegate to succeed Nixon,
for he felt that there must be no possibility of the
situation at Wadsworth being bungled a second
time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s one thing sure, however,” he had said
to Simpson, at parting; “they’re bound to have a
strike down there now, and there’s probably no way
to stop it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And Simpson had found this to be true. To have
attempted to withstand the white-hot fervour for a
strike would have been worse than foolish, and he
had yielded to it and called the strike. Now he was
bending every effort to make the strike a success;
or, at worst, to get out of the situation with as
little loss of prestige as possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the strike had not tied up the road as he had
hoped it would. Conductors and brakemen had refused
to go out without instructions from headquarters;
switchmen and operators had not even
asked for such instructions. And trains were running
regularly, manned by a lot of new men who
seemed fairly efficient. If the strike had started
out with a mistake, Simpson was resolved that no
others should be committed—especially not the
fatal mistake of violence. And so he was taking
care to establish himself in the liking and confidence
of the older and more conservative men. If it came
to a fight, he must be certain of his backing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Over at the freight-house, the new men had got
settled in their quarters and seemed fairly contented
with them. If truth were told, sordid and unattractive
as the surroundings were, most of the men
had been accustomed to much worse. The food,
too, however carelessly served, was at least clean
and wholesome, and only a person unused to anything
but china and snowy linen would have quarrelled
with the tin dishes and oil-cloth covered
tables.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was evident that the principal source of disturbance
had been removed when Hummel had been
compelled to leave the place; and yet there was no
telling when a second Hummel might arise and
leaven the entire group of men with discontent. Indeed,
it was evident that many of them were not
wholly at ease. In the midst of these unusually
comfortable surroundings, they perhaps felt the
same sense of disquiet which Jean Valjean felt in
the Bishop’s bed; they were accustomed to a plank
and could not sleep well upon springs and a mattress;
but this was not the sort of disquiet which
would lead to any serious results.</p>

<p class='c013'>And yet Reddy, who kept a keener eye than ever
upon events in Stanley’s absence, was not altogether
satisfied. Indeed, Stanley’s absence of itself puzzled
him. Orders had been given that the adventure
of the abandoned train was to be kept quiet as
long as possible, and no word concerning it had
been breathed inside the freight-house. So, as the
day wore on, Reddy grew more and more uneasy,
especially when he noted that Allan was also away.
He suspected that something was wrong somewhere,
and it annoyed him that he should be shut
up like this, away from all communication with his
fellow creatures. Certainly, he did not consider
the cook a fellow creature, and, in spite of himself,
he could not help feeling a sort of pitying contempt
for the strike-breakers. For Reddy was honest,
was industrious, was temperate, and he felt that
few of the strike-breakers were any of these things.</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ a fine figger you cut here, don’t you,” he
went on, following this train of thought, “washin’
dishes an’ makin’ beds an’ waitin’ on table, like a
saloon loafer, instead o’ doin’ an honest man’s
work! I’m goin’ t’ throw up the job. I ain’t doin’
no good here. These fellers are as contented as
a lot o’ hogs in the sunshine. I’ll jest tell Allan—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say!” suddenly bawled a voice in his ear, “air
ye goin’ t’ sleep on yer feet? Wake up, an’ git a
move!” and a heavy hand struck him a hard blow
on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reddy turned with a start, and the dish he was
wiping slipped from his hands to the floor. Of
course it did not break, as it was made of tin, but
it made a tremendous clatter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stoopid!” yelled the cook, sticking his red face
within a few inches of Reddy’s and waving his arms
violently. “Awkward! I never saw nothin’ to
beat you! You’re the limit!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aw, shut up,” growled Reddy, not yielding an
inch.</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ you calls yerself a dish-washer—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I don’t,” broke in Reddy. “An’ I never
will now that I’ve seen you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What!” shouted the cook, growing purple.
“I’ll show you—” and his arm was drawn back
to strike.</p>

<p class='c013'>But at that instant, Reddy’s fist was raised with
seeming slowness and gentleness under the other’s
jaw, and the cook, lifted by some mysterious force
cleanly off his feet, struck the floor with a thud.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good for you, turnip-top!” yelled one of the
strike-breakers, as they came crowding around, attracted
by the noise of the altercation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get up, cookie, get up!” yelled another. “You
ain’t out yet—don’t show yellow!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And Reddy, fairly dancing with rage, added his
insults to the others’.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Strike a gentleman, would ye!” he cried.
“Don’t lay there blinkin’ like that! Stand up an
take yer medicine like a man. Here, I’ll bring ye
around!” and snatching the pan of dirty dish water
from the table, he dashed it over his recumbent foe.</p>

<p class='c013'>A roar of laughter arose from the spectators;
this was the sort of thing most of them delighted
in; but their merriment acted on Reddy like a cold
shower. He took one glance at them and then
fiercely tore off the ragged piece of burlap he had
been using as an apron.</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ now I’ll bid ye good-bye,” he said. “I
was jest thinkin’ o’ quittin’—this job don’t suit
me,” and catching up his hat, he plunged through
the door and past the astonished guard on the platform
outside.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stop me if ye dare!” cried Reddy, and took
off his hat and threw it high in the air, but the
guard, recognizing him, turned away with a grin.
“My, but it does feel good t’ be out in the air again
an’ away from them dishes. I never knew before
how good air smelt.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He filled his lungs to the limit and exhaled
slowly, feeling as though a great weight had been
lifted from his shoulders. Then he stopped and
looked about the yards.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not much doin’,” he added, seeing the empty
sidings; and, indeed, for fear it could not fulfil its
engagements, the road was routing all the freight
business possible through Columbus by way of the
Midland division, instead of through Wadsworth,
and was even handing some of it over to competing
lines. “Why, hello, Jack!” he cried, as Jack Welsh
suddenly turned the corner of the freight-house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack stared at him in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it you, Reddy?” he asked. “When did you
get out?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith,” said Reddy, his eyes twinkling, “it
sounds like I’d been in the workhouse an’ me niver
arrested in me life! I’ve throwed up me job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Throwed up your job?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Since when have ye turned into an echo?” demanded
Reddy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack laughed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was too surprised t’ say anything original.
What was the trouble?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I couldn’t stand it—I couldn’t stand them
vermin, nor washin’ dishes nor makin’ beds fer ’em—nor
I couldn’t stand that varmint of a cook. He
got smart,” went on Reddy, growing angry again at
thought of it, “so I jest upper-cut him an’ throwed
some dish water on him an’ come away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But,” protested Jack, “what will Allan say?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t care what he says,” retorted Reddy,
doggedly. “I ain’t needed in there—them fellers
is like a flock of sheep—feed ’em an’ water ’em an’
they’ll never give any trouble. Besides, where <i>is</i>
Allan—an’ where’s Stanley? Is there trouble
somewheres, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ain’t you heard about extra west last night?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nary a word—a felly might as well be in his
grave as in that freight-shed. What about extra
west?”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Jack told him the story of the abandoned
train and missing crew, while Reddy stood listening
with starting eyes and open mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if that don’t beat anything I ever heard!”
he said, when Jack had finished. “But Allan and
Stanley wasn’t there—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; they went out this mornin’ t’ look over the
ground. They was expectin’ t’ come back this arternoon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A sudden shadow seemed to pass across Reddy’s
face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the matter?” asked Jack, noticing it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was jest thinkin’,” said Reddy, speaking with
some difficulty, “that I’d ’a’ liked to gone along.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So would I, but I wasn’t asked.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, good-bye,” Reddy said, turning away.
“I’ve got t’ go home an’ see my missus, an’ git a
decent meal. Jack,” he added, stopping and looking
back, “if they don’t come back, let’s go out
ourselves in the mornin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, they’ll be back,” said Jack, confidently.
“Allan, anyway. He knows he’s needed here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But the cloud had not lifted from Reddy’s face,
as he walked away across the yards in the direction
of his home.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>The afternoon passed, and nothing was heard
from either Allan or Stanley; evening fell, and
still no sign of them. The disappointed reporters
champed and swore and tried to inveigle the story
out of some of the other employees of the office, but
in vain; and finally, driven to desperation, they
concocted such accounts of the affair as their several
imaginations were capable of.</p>

<p class='c013'>One thing they knew. The road’s chief dispatcher
and detective were absent. From an absence
to a disappearance is but a step, and it was
with a certain satisfaction that they played up this
feature of the case. At least, they would get even
with West for trying to keep the news away from
them. They described his career, his appearance,
dwelt upon Stanley’s well-known prowess and fearlessness,
and drew the conclusion that something
extraordinary must have occurred to get the best
of him. It made a good story, and the public read
and was interested and mystified and wondered languidly
how it would all turn out—and passed on
to the next sensation.</p>

<p class='c013'>But in one home, at least, as the weary hours of
the night wore on, there was something more than
languid interest and wonder. From her snowy
bed, Mamie Welsh lay staring up into the darkness,
her face flushed and feverish, her eyes red with
weeping, striving to suppress the sobs which shook
her, so that her mother might not hear and understand.</p>

<p class='c013'>For she knew, by a sort of clairvoyance, as
though his spirit called through space to hers, that
Allan West lay somewhere in great peril.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>It was dark when Allan struggled back to consciousness,—not
dark in the ordinary sense, but
pitch dark,—a blackness that oppressed and chilled
with the sense of some unknown and unspeakable
peril. He lay for a long time without moving,
without thinking, just conscious in a dim way that
he existed. Gradually he became aware of an all-pervading
pain, which finally resolved into an aching
head and an aching shoulder and cramped legs
and arms. Then, in a flash, life surged in on him
and he remembered the old stone house, the barn,
the shadow, the blow which he had tried to avoid.</p>

<p class='c013'>He struggled to get to his feet, only to fall back
with a groan of anguish; for his hands were tied
behind him and his feet were lashed together. Even
had he been free, his whirling, aching head would
have chained him down.</p>

<p class='c013'>But his head grew clearer after a while and he
could think connectedly. Where was he? Not in
the barn, that was certain, for he could feel beneath
him a floor of boards, instead of the wet and
clammy dirt upon which he had fallen. In the
house, then—his unknown assailant had carried
him into the house, tied him hand and foot and left
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>For what purpose?</p>

<p class='c013'>But that was a question for which he could find
no reasonable answer; nor could he even guess at
his assailant’s identity. This murderous assault had
made the mystery more puzzling than ever, for he
could guess at no motive for it. Certainly he was
not the victim of personal enmity, for he knew that
he had no enemies—Dan Nolan’s death had delivered
him from the only one he ever had who was
capable of resorting to such methods as this. Nor
could he see how his being held a prisoner here
could possibly be of any benefit to anyone. Indeed,
there was certain to be a hue and cry after him if
he was held a prisoner long. Stanley would know
where to look for him—and there were Jack and
Reddy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan’s eyes filled with tears as he thought of
the anxiety they were doubtless suffering. And
Mamie—was she suffering, too? Somehow, the
thought of her was a very dear and moving one,
and he whispered her name over and over to himself.
If only—</p>

<p class='c013'>He felt singularly weak and helpless; he could
do nothing but lie where he was and await the will
of his captors. He wondered vaguely what they
would do with him, and he turned the thought over
in his mind with a kind of impersonal interest as
though it were not at all himself, but someone else
entirely who was principally concerned. It seemed
almost as though he were watching a drama in
which he himself was an actor.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cramped posture in which he lay became insupportable
at last, and he managed, with infinite
suffering, to turn himself over on his side. Then,
finding himself somewhat easier, he at last dropped
off to sleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was awakened by a flash of light in his eyes.
For a minute, he saw only a dim figure holding a
lantern, then, with clearing vision, he found himself
staring into a face which sent a chill of horror
through him. Never before had he seen a face so
repulsive. The round head, set low between the
shoulders, was crowned by a dirty towsel of hair
which fell over the low forehead almost into the
eyes. These, bloodshot and venomous, were sunk
deep into the head and ambushed under bristling
eyebrows. The nose, a mere unformed lump of
flesh, overhung a mouth whose pendulous, blackened
lips were parted in a malicious grin. The figure
was squat and heavy, telling of great strength
and even of a certain agility; but to the figure Allan
gave only a single glance, for the face fascinated
him as only superlatively ugly things can.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a moment, this being stood shading his eyes
from the lantern light with a great, hairy hand, and
staring down at his prisoner. Then, with a hoarse
grunt of satisfaction, he turned toward the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Allan, mustering all his courage, shouted
after him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold on!” he cried. “Hold on!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The fellow hesitated for an instant, and then
turned back, and stood regarding Allan with that
diabolical leer still upon his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s all this about?” demanded Allan, steeling
himself to endure the gaze of those crafty and
threatening eyes. “How long am I going to be
kept here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>His captor laughed, or rather emitted a low
rumble.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not long,” he croaked, hoarsely. “Not long.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My friends will be after me in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let ’em!” and again came that rumbling laughter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will go hard with you if they find me here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t worry; they won’t find you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>But the other only laughed again by way of
answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was it you who struck me out there in the
stable?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It surely was.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What had I done?”</p>

<p class='c013'>A spasm of hate crossed the ferocious face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You hadn’t no business out there nor around
here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Maybe not,” Allan admitted. “Let me go and
I’ll clear out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The words were greeted by a burst of laughter,
so wild that Allan was suddenly convinced that he
had to do with a wild man, a lunatic wholly irresponsible
for his actions. The thought sent a
deeper chill through him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me go,” he urged more gently. “I have
done you no harm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ain’t you, though!” retorted his strange companion.
“Well, you’ll never do nobody else no
harm, neither.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And without heeding the entreaties Allan sent
after him, he went out and closed the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan heard his footsteps die away along the hall
outside, and then, after a moment, came that queer
murmur of voices which he had heard from the
back door, only louder and clearer. And a sudden
conviction leaped into his mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>The missing train crew was imprisoned here also.</p>

<p class='c013'>He listened with bated breath as the murmur
grew and grew, and finally died away as though
it had spent itself. He judged that his captor had
visited the other prisoners to make sure they were
all safe, and had then departed.</p>

<p class='c013'>But who was this wild man? What sort of monster
was this which had been let loose upon the
world? How, single handed, had he been able to
capture five men? And what was his object in doing
so?</p>

<p class='c013'>Here were three questions to which no reasonable
answer seemed possible. Allan felt almost as
though he were living through some terrible nightmare,
from which he must presently awaken.
Surely such things as this could not happen here
in Ohio, in the midst of a thickly populated country!
In the Middle Ages, perhaps; but not here
in the twentieth century!</p>

<p class='c013'>The pain of his position had become excessive,
and he rolled over on his back, and sought to ease
himself a little. He could feel that his hair was
clotted with blood, and from the pain in his shoulder
he was convinced that a bone had been broken—his
collar-bone, probably. His head grew giddy
after a while and a deathly sickness came upon him.
The close and fetid atmosphere of the room seemed
to stifle him. He shrieked aloud, but there was no
response, and presently he lapsed into a sort of half-consciousness.</p>

<p class='c013'>He fancied that he was stretched upon the rack,
that black-hooded inquisitors were advancing to the
torture. He could feel the bonds about hands and
feet slowly tighten and stretch, and a pang of agony
shot through him. What was it they wanted him
to confess? Something involving Jack—something
involving Mamie. No, he would never confess—after
all, there was nothing to confess—it
was a lie they were trying to wring from him.
Again the cords tightened and stretched; he was
being torn asunder, but he clenched his teeth and
crushed back the groan which would have burst
from him. Again—and this time there was no
resisting, and he cried aloud—</p>

<p class='c013'>Cried aloud and opened his eyes, and, after a
moment, realized where he was. He was panting
for breath, for the air was thick with smoke. Afar
off, he could hear a frantic shouting, which beat
in upon his brain and turned him faint, so agonized
it was. They were torturing some one else—they
had left him for the moment to regain some
measure of strength. No, they had decided to suffocate
him; they had started a fire under him—it
was to be the trial of flame! Mamie, Mamie—he
would never tell!</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, suddenly, he understood. The house was
on fire—that madman had fired it—that shouting
was from the other prisoners, who were perhaps
already being roasted alive! Roasted alive!</p>

<p class='c013'>He wrenched frantically at his bonds, but they
held as though of iron. He struggled to a sitting
posture, but could rise no further. By an effort
almost superhuman, he dragged himself to the door,
and turning his back to it, tore at it with his fingers.
Then he managed to raise himself so that his fingers
clutched the latch; the door swung open and
he fell backward into the hall.</p>

<p class='c013'>That fall racked him with agony, but, with sweat
running down his face in little rivulets, he managed
to grovel forward, inch by inch, pushing himself
along by his legs, sparing his injured shoulder as
much as he could. One foot, two feet, three feet.
Then, suddenly, he realized that his head was hanging
over an abyss—his shoulders were over—and
in an instant he had pitched forward wildly,
and fell shrieking into the darkness.</p>

  <h2 id='ch21' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXI <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>“C. Q. D.”</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>I<span class='sc'>n</span> the gray dawn of the winter morning, Mamie
Welsh started wide awake from the restless doze
into which she had fallen. She sat up in bed, her
head to one side as though listening for some faint
and distant sound. Then, with a quick movement,
she threw back the bed-clothes, slipped to the floor,
pulled a shawl about her, thrust her feet into a pair
of slippers, and ran to the door of the room where
her father and mother slept.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mary Welsh, a light sleeper at all times, was
awake at the first tap of Mamie’s fingers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who’s there?” she called.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s me, Mamie.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the matter, dearie?” cried Mrs. Welsh,
jumping out of bed and hastening to open the door.
“What’s the matter?” she repeated, her arms about
her daughter. “Not sick?” For Mamie’s face in
the dim light was positively ghastly, so livid and
drawn it was.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I—I’m not sick,” sobbed Mamie, suddenly
giving way and clinging desperately to her
mother. “I—I don’t know what it is, only I’m
so worried about Allan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And Mrs. Welsh, with a sudden tightening of
the heart, understood.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There, there,” she said, and she drew her
daughter’s head down upon her shoulder and patted
her soothingly. “There, there; he’ll be back safe
an’ sound, dearie, never fear!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But oh! mother! I dreamed such a terrible
dream. He was in some awful danger, hurt and
bleeding, in the dark, and a horrible man was torturing
him, and he called to me and held out his
hands. I heard his voice, mother, as plainly as I
hear yours—it woke me up,” and Mamie shivered
convulsively at the remembrance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Welsh was no more superstitious than the
ordinary Irish woman, but there was something
in the words—something in the voice which uttered
them—which somehow struck a responsive
chord in her, and she shivered in sympathy with the
trembling figure she held in her arms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, meanwhile, disturbed by all this talking,
suddenly awakened to find his wife missing, and
sat up in bed rubbing his eyes and staring at the
ghostly figures near the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who’s that?” he asked, but a convulsive sob
from Mamie told who it was, and thoroughly
awakened at last, he was out of bed in an instant.
“What’s wrong?” he demanded. “What’s the
matter with you women?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mamie’s worried about Allan,” answered Mrs.
Welsh, hugging tight the shivering figure in her
arms.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, dad!” sobbed Mamie. “I dreamed about
him and he—he was calling me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Calling you? What d’ye mean, Mamie?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He was calling me to come to him. Oh, dad,
we must go!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go?” repeated Jack, in amazement. “Go
where?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Out to Schooley’s—or wherever it is—you
will, won’t you, dad?”</p>

<p class='c013'>She had her arms around her father, now, and
there was a pathos, an entreaty in her voice that
wrung his heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was goin’ out this mornin’, anyway,” he said,
smoothing her hair gently, “an’ I guess I might
as well start now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I’m going with you, dad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no,” he protested. “What good would
that do, Mamie?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good!” she cried. “Why, dad, you don’t
know where to find him!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And do you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Her face changed—seemed to whiten and
harden—and her eyes stared past them into the
gloom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes!” she whispered, her hands clasped tight
against her heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Welsh, her hand grasping Jack’s arm,
nodded to him to consent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” he agreed, his voice not wholly
steady. “All right, Mamie. Jump into your
clothes. Maybe we kin ketch first ninety-eight.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Neither Jack Welsh nor his wife could ever explain
the spirit of desperate haste which suddenly
possessed them. Mamie, apparently in a sort of
trance, returned to her room and dressed herself
deliberately and calmly, but with a wonderful celerity,
as surely as she could have done in broad daylight;
while Jack, in the semi-darkness, bungled
into his clothes somehow, his fingers all thumbs.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Welsh, meanwhile, throwing a wrapper
around her, hastened downstairs, and when the
other two came down five minutes later—Mamie
having assisted her father in the last stages of his
toilet—she had a cup of hot coffee for each of
them, and a lunch done up in a napkin for them
to take along. She kissed them both at the front
door and stood watching them until they were out
of sight. Then she turned slowly back into the
house, blew out the lamp in the kitchen, and
mounted to her bedroom. But not to sleep. In the
cold light of the dawn, she sank on her knees beside
the bed and buried her face in her hands.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Jack and Mamie reached the yards just as Bill
Grimes, the conductor of first ninety-eight, was
raising his hand to give the signal to start. He was
charmed to have them as his guests, and hustled
them into the caboose, much to the embarrassment
of an impressionable young brakeman, who was
just changing his shoes. He thought he had never
seen anything so lovely as Mamie, and stammered
profuse apologies, which Mamie acknowledged with
an absent-minded nod. Poor fellow! her thoughts
were far away from him.</p>

<p class='c013'>He cheerfully undertook to climb forward over
the long train and to ask the engineer to slow up
at the spot where the abandoned train had been
discovered, and fifteen minutes later, at some risk
to life and limb, he was at the caboose steps to
assist Mamie to alight.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the train gathered speed again, conductor and
brakeman shouted back good wishes; then the rumble
died away in the distance, and the train disappeared
in the morning mist.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, and now what?” asked Jack Welsh,
looking down at his daughter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Something in her face arrested his gaze, a certain
strained and fixed expression, as though she
were gazing inward instead of outward, as though
she were stretching every sense to catch the sound
of some inward voice, faint and far-away.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack felt a little shiver creep along his spine
and up over his scalp, as he noted that fixed gaze.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, and now what?” he asked again.
“What is it you’re listenin’ for, Mamie?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“His voice,” she answered, almost in a whisper.
“‘Twill guide us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Surely,” protested Jack, “you don’t expect—”</p>

<p class='c013'>But without waiting for him to finish, Mamie
turned abruptly away from the railroad, and
plunged into the strip of woodland which stretched
beside it. There was no semblance of a path, but
she hurried forward without pausing, and at the
end of a few minutes they came to a road. Without
an instant’s hesitation, Mamie turned eastward
along it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Toward Schooley’s,” Jack muttered to himself.
“That’s all right. But how the dickens did she
know it was here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mamie, meanwhile, looking neither to the right
nor left, hurried along the road as fast as her feet
would carry her. It was hard and rutted and anything
but easy walking, yet the girl seemed to take
no account of the roughness of the way, and Jack,
panting and stumbling along behind, marvelled at
the ease with which she hastened on. The sun had
not yet risen, and gray cold mist of the morning
still lingered among the trees. To the superstitious
Irishman there seemed to be something ghostly
and supernatural in the air; he felt that some mysterious
and unseen influence was at work, and the
thought brought a cold sweat out across his forehead.
Yet never for an instant did he think of
trying to stop her or of turning back himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then suddenly, from afar off, Jack’s ears caught
the sound of a faint singing or crying, that rose
and fell in a sort of weird cadence, impossible to
describe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s that?” he cried, and stopped short;
but instead of pausing, Mamie broke into a run,
and would have been out of sight in a moment had
not Jack followed at top speed. In the end, his
strength and agility told even against the strange
spirit that possessed her, and he gained her side
just as they reached the edge of a clearing, in the
midst of which stood an old stone house.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good God! It’s afire!” gasped Jack, and, indeed,
a black swirl of smoke was pouring from the
broken windows at the front of the house, lighted
redly here and there from instant to instant by a
tongue of flame. “Wait, Mamie,” he added, grasping
her arm as she started forward. “What ’r
you goin’ t’ do?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s there!” Mamie cried, shaking him away,
and without another word, she started toward the
house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, gritting his teeth tight together, followed
her. There was need of courage, for that weird
sing-song chanting still persisted, and as they
neared the house, a strange figure appeared around
the corner—a squat, deformed figure, surmounted
by a hideous face and great shock of dirty hair.
It was dancing in a clumsy and ungainly fashion
and was emitting from time to time the hoarse
shouting which had set Jack’s nerves on edge.</p>

<div id='p248'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/p248.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>“THEN, WITH A HOARSE YELL OF RAGE, HURLED HIMSELF UPON THEM.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>For an instant, the fellow did not perceive them;
then, as his bloodshot eyes rested upon them, he
stood for a breath as though carved in stone, and
then, with a hoarse yell of rage, hurled himself
upon them.</p>

<p class='c013'>How Mamie escaped that savage onrush, she
never knew. Jack had a confused recollection of
seeing her spring aside to escape the madman’s
swinging arms, and in the next instant he found
himself grappling with him, hurled backward off
his feet, with great, hairy hands tearing at his
throat. He felt himself helpless as a child in this
powerful and cruel grasp, and his heart turned faint
within him as he stared upward into the convulsed
and hideous face glaring down at him. He dashed
his fists against it, with almost as little effect as
though he had dashed them against a rock, and
ever those hands at his throat tightened and tightened.
The world danced red before him—it was
no use—no use—</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, suddenly, a thought flashed lightning-like
into his brain—if he failed her now, Mamie would
be left alone with this monster—at his mercy—</p>

<p class='c013'>Mad with rage, fairly foaming at the mouth,
fired with a strength almost superhuman, Jack
twisted his assailant to one side and tore his hands
from his throat. One full breath of the cold air—it
was all he had time for, before those hands closed
upon him again. This was no human being, he told
himself despairingly; it was a monster against
which he could not hope to prevail; it wasn’t fair
to put a man up against a thing like this; nobody
could blame him if he failed—but Mamie—there
was Mamie—</p>

<p class='c013'>His hand, flung out convulsively, touched something
hard and round; mechanically he grasped it—mechanically
he struck with it at the face above
him—once—twice—thrice. And he felt the
hands at his throat relax, saw dimly the savage
countenance running red with blood, felt the great
body lurch heavily forward across him—and lay
gasping for breath, too weak, for the moment, to
throw it off.</p>

<p class='c013'>But only for a moment; then, twisting the body
to one side, he staggered to his feet and stared first
at it and then at the boulder he still grasped in his
hand; and not till then did he understand what
had happened—by what a slender chance he had
been saved—and not he alone, but Mamie—</p>

<p class='c013'>Mamie! He turned to look for her. She was
nowhere in sight, and forgetting all else, he staggered
forward toward the burning house. He tried
the front door and found it fastened, shook at it
savagely without effect, and then hastened around
the house to the rear.</p>

<p class='c013'>The back door was open, a flood of smoke pouring
from it. And as he stared stupidly at it, he
saw a nebulous figure struggling through it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sight brought his senses back, brought his
strength back. He sprang forward, and in another
moment, he and Mamie, between them, had
dragged Allan West out into the open air, bleeding,
bound, unconscious.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What they been doin’ to the boy?” cried Jack,
a white-hot rage almost choking him. “Have they
kilt him—have the cowards kilt him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no; oh, no!” sobbed Mamie, dropping on
her knees beside him. “Oh, look, dad, they’ve tied
his hands and feet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The scoundrels!” and Jack, whipping out his
knife, had the bonds severed in an instant. “His
head’s all bloody,” he added, “an’ look how that
rope’s cut his wrists! Good God! What kind o’
fiends—”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Mamie, with more self-control than he, laid
a restraining hand upon his arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t, dad,” she said. “Don’t think of that
now. Time enough afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re right,” and Jack mastered himself by
a mighty effort.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We must get some water,” said Mamie, and
then as she looked down at the white, bruised, unconscious
face, a wave of misery swept over her,
a suffocating sense of her own helplessness. “We
must do something!” she cried wringing her
hands in anguish. “We must—oh!—”</p>

<p class='c013'>She stopped suddenly, and pressed her hands
against her wildly-beating heart, for Allan’s eyes
slowly unclosed and he lay looking up at her. Then
his face brightened into a smile, and an instant
later twitched with the agony the slight movement
cost him. His eyes were caught by the cloud of
smoke drifting upward from the house, and his
expression changed from agony to horror.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We must get the others,” he gasped, and tried
to rise.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no,” protested Mamie, her arms about him.
“Lie still—you must—”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Allan had fainted dead away.</p>

<p class='c012'>T<span class='sc'>hey</span> tell the story yet on the P. &amp; O., and, indeed,
everywhere that railroad men foregather—they
tell it with shining eyes and fast-beating hearts—how
Jack Welsh, grasping in an instant the
meaning of Allan’s words, tied his handkerchief
over mouth and nose, and fought his way inch by
inch into that burning house, crawling on hands
and knees with his face close to the floor where the
smoke was thinnest—fought his way up the stairs
and from room to room, until he found the one
where five men lay, bound and senseless, on the
floor; and they tell how he dragged them one by
one to the open air, feeling the hot floor tremble
under him toward the end, and himself falling unconscious
beside the last man as he dropped him to
the ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>They tell the story with the proud consciousness
that this man was one of themselves, and that what
he did was done in the way of duty, with no thought
of fame or reward, without pausing to count the
risk.</p>

<p class='c013'>But even this heroism might have been of small
avail, had not Reddy Magraw at that instant come
upon the scene. Let him tell the story, as he told
it next day to Mrs. Welsh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know, whin I come down to your house
the first thing in the mornin’ an’ found Jack had
gone out to Schooley’s, I was purty mad, fer we
had kind of arranged t’ go out there togither, if
Allan didn’t show up; an’ it didn’t seem t’ me
that he was playin’ just fair, though o’ course I
understand now that he didn’t have time t’ call me.
Well, I made up my mind I’d git out there as quick
as I could, so I hopped the first train I could ketch,
which was second ninety-eight, and I reckon I must
have jumped off not more’n half an hour after
Jack an’ Mamie did—though mind you, you hadn’t
said anything about Mamie goin’ along, an’ I
reckon I know why,” and here he stopped for a
long look deep into Mrs. Welsh’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go ahead with the story,” she said. “Though
I don’t say you ain’t right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“O’ course I’m right,” said Reddy, confidently.
“Well, as I was sayin’, I got off the train an’ wandered
around fer some time, an’ then struck the
road an’ started t’ foller it; an’ purty soon I seed
smoke over the tree-tops an’ after that I didn’t
loiter none, I tell you.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, sir, when I run around the corner o’ that
house, I purty nigh dropped dead in my tracks.
There on the ground lay about a dozen men, as it
seemed to me; there was the lunatic, an’ a sight
he was, with his face all covered with blood; an’
there was Jack, an’ his face was covered with blood,
too, but not his own, the lunatic’s; and there was
Allan West, lookin’ deader ’n a salt mackerel; there
was five other fellys, some a-layin’ nice an’ still,
an’ some kind o’ squirmin’ around an’ moanin’;
an’ there was Mamie, with Allan’s head in her lap
a-lookin’ most dead herself; an’ when I see her
settin’ there, I tell you my heart jest seemed to swell
up inside me like it was a-goin’ t’ bust.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I didn’t know no more what to do than
a rabbit. There was eight men whose lives depended
on me, more or less; not that I’d ’a’ cared
about the lunatic, but even without him there was
seven, an’ me no doctor, neither. But Mamie certainly
did show what was in her. Where she
learned it I don’t know, but she set me t’ pumpin’
them fellers’ arms up an’ down n’ blowin’ down
their throats—Jack an’ Allan first—an’ it wasn’t
a great while till Jack came around. He was kind
o’ weak an’ giddy, but not fer long; an’ in ten
or fifteen minutes, we had three others all right;
an’ jest about then, the lunatic began to come to,
so we tied his hands an’ feet t’ make sure he didn’t
git away, or sneak up on any of us from behind
an’ cave our heads in. An’ when he did come to,
he laid there an’ cussed somethin’ frightful. I
wanted t’ hit him with the rock ag’in, but Mamie
said no, to gag him, an’ we stuffed his mouth full
of his own dirty clothes, an’ I guess he wished he’d
kept ’em cleaner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But what worried us most of all was Allan.
He jest laid there limp as a rag, an’ Mamie workin’
with him, purty nigh as white as he was.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He can’t die!” she kept saying to herself, over
and over. “He can’t die! It was God brought me
here to save him, and he can’t die now!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The smoke and flames had burst up from the
burning house, a beacon to all the country-side, and
assistance was at hand ere long; strong hands and
tender hearts; and presently two great wagons,
bedded with straw to take conscious and unconscious
alike to Schooley’s, whither already a swift
rider had been dispatched to summon aid from
Wadsworth. And at Wadsworth, too, it may well
be believed that no time was lost. A special was
got ready in a hurry; doctors and nurses summoned;
and when the little cavalcade reached
Schooley’s, the special was waiting there for it;
and trained hands took over the work of relief.</p>

<p class='c013'>Trained hands which worked swiftly and surely,
and presently Allan opened his eyes and looked up
at Mamie and smiled at her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear Mamie!” he murmured and closed his
eyes and slept.</p>

<p class='c013'>And the overwrought girl, conscious for the first
time of her utter fatigue, reeled and would have
fallen had not a strong arm caught her and carried
her to a cot.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have wondered often what force it was drew
Mamie from her bed, that morning, with sure
knowledge of Allan’s danger, and guided her to
him along that rutted country road. The human
mind is a strange and wonderful thing, with the
seeming power of projecting itself through space,
at times, and summoning loved ones or conveying
a message to them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Science seems to admit so much—or, at least,
hesitates to deny it, in face of the evidence. And
I have sometimes thought that, as Allan fell
through the swirling smoke down that flight of
stairs in the old stone house, his last conscious
thought of Mamie, that thought somehow flashed
to her across the miles that lay between them—a
C. Q. D. signal of distress, as it were, from him to
her, on the wonderful wireless of the mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>At least, I have no other explanation—I only
know it really happened just as I have told it
here.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>A great crowd was waiting when that special
pulled in to Wadsworth—a crowd which cheered
and cheered as Allan and Jack Welsh and Mamie
were borne to the carriages which were in waiting;
a crowd from which three women threw themselves
upon the conductor and brakemen, weak but smiling;
a crowd which cursed the idiot and would
have torn him from his cot and committed I know
not what violence but for the platoon of police,
assisted by Stanley’s specials, with Stanley himself,
saturnine yet smiling, at the head of them.</p>

<p class='c013'>For Stanley had returned and with him three
prisoners and a wagon load of the richest silks ever
shipped over an American railroad.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the whole thing had been a case of robbery,
after all, just as Stanley had suspected.</p>

<p class='c013'>It had been carefully planned. The conspirators—old
hands at the game—had learned that
a shipment of silks of unusual richness had been
made by a New York house to its jobbers in Saint
Louis—had even received from some traitorous
clerk the number of the car in which they were
carried—had flagged the train, took conductor and
brakemen prisoners, as they hurried forward to find
out what the red light meant; had afterwards secured
the engineer and fireman at the point of a
revolver, extinguished the headlight, and looted the
car at their leisure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, after carefully sealing it up again so that
the robbery would not be discovered until the car
arrived at its destination, they had convoyed the
prisoners to the old stone house, and committed
them to the care of the half-witted monster they
had brought with them from the city slums, with
instructions that they be released in forty-eight
hours, in which time they fancied they would be
able to get well beyond reach of pursuit.</p>

<p class='c013'>But they had not fully appreciated their confederate’s
crazed condition; they had not foreseen in
what a horrible way he would carry out their instructions—give
them credit for that. Nor had
they foreseen that, within a very few hours, one
of the keenest detectives in the middle west would
be after them. They had thought such search as
would be made would be for the missing men, and
had hoped that, in the disorganized condition of the
road, no very effective search could be made at
all.</p>

<p class='c013'>How Stanley followed them, like the bloodhound
that he was, and finally ran them down need
not be related in detail here. Stanley himself has
told the story in the book of memoirs which he published
after he had retired from active service.
Once he had got his clue to them, the rest was a
question of only a few hours; for a wagon heavily
laden cannot proceed at any great rate of speed,
nor can it pass along the roads unseen. He had
sworn in two deputies at a farm house, and with
their assistance, had no difficulty in surprising the
robbers, as they jogged along a country road, thinking
themselves quite secure. It was merely the
matter of a levelled revolver and a stern command,
and the application of certain lengths of rope to
wrists and ankles. Then, turning the wagon about,
he had driven in triumph back to Wadsworth,
reaching there just at dawn.</p>

<p class='c013'>And the first news he had heard was of Allan’s
disappearance. Puzzled and worried, he had seen
his prisoners lodged safely in the county jail, and
was just preparing to join the search himself, when
news of the rescue flashed in from Schooley’s.</p>

<p class='c013'>Oh, but there were crazy people on Wadsworth’s
streets that day—people wild with excitement,
telling the story over and over to each other, shaking
each other’s hands, repeating this detail or
that as though they would never tire of hearing it.
And the reporters! Well, the wildest stretch of
their imaginations had conceived no such story as
this! And they flashed it forth to the four points
of the compass, so that, next morning, the whole
country read the tale of the heroism of Jack Welsh
and his daughter, Mamie.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>It was perhaps, a year afterwards that the postman,
one morning, brought a little registered package
for John Welsh. Jack chanced to be at home
that morning, and opened the package in considerable
surprise, for registered packages were not of
common occurrence with him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, what’s this?” he said, and held up what
appeared to be a medal of gold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s see it,” said Mary, quickly, and examined
it with eager eyes. “Why, look!” she cried. “On
one side is a woman holdin’ a wreath, an’ on the
other it says ‘To John Welsh, for valour, February
2, 1906.’ It’s from the hayro fund!” she cried.
“Jack—”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Jack, looking very red and uncomfortable,
had bolted from the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I does my work,” he muttered angrily to himself,
as he strode up the street, “but I ain’t no
hayro, an’ what’s more, I won’t be one! What do
they mean by sendin’ me a medal? Confound their
impudence, anyway. Why can’t they leave a feller
alone? I don’t want their old medal!”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Mary put it carefully away, and it is to this
day her dearest treasure, to be shown proudly
whenever the story of Jack’s exploit is told—provided,
always, that Jack isn’t there!</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>And the robbers? Conviction followed, as a
matter of course. There could be no doubt of their
guilt, and in the end they saw the wisdom of confessing
and throwing themselves upon the mercy
of the court. The madman was consigned to an
asylum for the criminally insane, where he remains
to this day, occupying for the most part a straitjacket
and a padded cell, for he has never recovered
from his lust of blood and instinct to murder.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>“W<span class='sc'>ell</span>, well; wonders will niver cease!” remarked
Reddy Magraw, contemplating the newspaper
he held in his hand—Reddy safe once more
in the bosom of his family, a hero if there ever
was one, a czar whose slightest word was law—and,
all in all, as true and loyal and honest and
warm-hearted an Irishman as ever lived in this
world.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it?” asked Mrs. Magraw, looking over
his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That,” answered Reddy, slapping the page with
his open hand—a page overflowing with heavy
headlines and further embellished with a group of
photographs. “Now who’d ’a’ thought that anybody
would iver want t’ put my ugly mug in the
paper?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure ’tis no uglier than lots of others,” protested
Mrs. Magraw, gazing at it fondly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe so; but this here picter don’t look
nothin’ like what I see when I looks in the glass.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Mrs. Magraw, examining it critically,
“it ain’t jest what I’d call a perfect likeness;
but the eyes are yours an’ the nose an’ the mouth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If they are, they ain’t put together right,” said
Reddy. “I’ve often wondered how a criminal
could git away when the papers all over the country
was printin’ his picter, but I understand now. If
I’d done somethin’ an’ was runnin’ away an’ was
arrested on suspicion, I could prove by that picter
that they’d got the wrong man.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, anyways,” said Mrs. Magraw, “we gits
half a dozen cabinets fer lettin’ ’em take it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Twas real generous,” agreed Reddy. “But I
wish they was of the baby. I niver thought that
I’d iver ag’in face a cammery. The last picter I
had took, darlint, was whin I was courtin’ ye.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, an’ I’ve got it yet, as ye know,” said Mrs.
Magraw, “an’ a love of a picter it is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All that I raymimber about it is that me pants
was very tight an’ me shoes was killin’ me,” said
Reddy, with a smile of reminiscence. “However,
I was ready an’ willin’ to suffer any torture—even
to cuttin’ off me toes if ye thought me feet too
big.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As if I iver looked at yer feet! It was in your
honest blue eyes that I looked, Reddy Magraw, an’
nowheres else.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I reckon we didn’t either of us make no
mistake, darlint,” said Reddy comfortably. “We
ain’t niver been bothered by a bank account, ’tis
true; but nayther have we starved or gone naked.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Magraw patted him on the shoulder as a
token of her approval of the sentiment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s see the other picters,” she said. “There’s
Jack Welsh an’ Stanley—trust him t’ have his
picter ready.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” chuckled Reddy, “an’ anybody could
recognize it a mile off by the nose.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But where’s Allan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Reddy chuckled again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Didn’t have none; neither did Mamie—at
least, that’s what they said. But that didn’t trouble
most o’ the papers none. They jest went ahead
an’ made ’em up. One feller must ’a’ cut his picter
o’ Mamie out of a fashion paper, an’ another used
one of them skinny magazine girls, with their hair
all a-flyin’ around their faces. An’ Allan—he
looks like one of them young hayroes from the
ready-made suit advertisements.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ does that look like the house?” asked Mrs.
Magraw, indicating a building, with smoke and
flames pouring from it in a truly terrifying manner,
which further ornamented the newspaper’s account
of the rescue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Reddy, cautiously, “it does in a
gineral way. It’s got four walls an’ a roof an’
some windeys. Furder ’n that I wouldn’t keer t’
go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ have ye read the story?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; I’ve read it. An’ a very purty story it
is—a very purty work of the imagination. You
should read it, an’ see what a liar yer husband is.
I allers did admire them newspaper felleys. T’
hear them tell the story, you’d think they was right
on the scene—an’ them that was there can’t recognize
the place.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Mrs. Magraw, in amazement, “I
allers thought I could believe what I saw in the
papers. What’ll I do now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do as I do, darlint,” replied her husband;
“read the papers not fer instruction but fer entytainment.”</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>The story of the abandoned train and the eleventh
hour rescue of its crew was a nine days’ wonder.
There was the hearing of the case, the robbers’
confession, the lapse into violent insanity of the
murderous idiot, the serious condition of two of
the crew, and of the young chief dispatcher who
had risked his life searching for them. All these
kept up the interest from day to day, adding new
fuel to the flames, and the enterprising reporters
made the most of them. The two brakemen recovered,
however, in a few days, but nearly a week
had elapsed before the doctor, coming down from
the room where Allan West lay, pronounced him
out of danger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Careful nursing is all he needs now,” he said,
“and I know he’ll get that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You kin be sure of it,” said Mary. “This
ain’t the first time he’s needed it an’ got it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know that,” and the doctor smiled. “It was
I, you know, who took that bullet out of him and
who fixed those broken ribs. He’s surely had his
share.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ every time,” said Mary, with spirit, “it
was a-doin’ some other man’s work—a-doin’ somethin’
he thought was his duty, where the other man
would most likely have runned away.”</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>It was a very white and shaky, but thoroughly
cheerful boy who smiled up at Mary Welsh five
minutes later, when she mounted the stairs with
the good news.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Though it’s more ’n you deserve,” she added,
with simulated wrath; “for ever pokin’ your nose
in where you ain’t no business to.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What!” protested Allan, “would you have had
me let those five poor fellows burn to death!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; but when they’s detective work t’ do, let
the detective do it. What’s Stanley for?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He was busy doing something else. And that
reminds me—I must see him right away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right away, indade!” cried Mary, with an
indignant snort. “Next week, mebbe, if the doctor—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I guess I’ll have to get up and hunt him,”
said Allan, and made a movement as though to
rise.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lay still; lay still,” said Mary hastily, “an’
I’ll send fer him,” but Allan, smiling to himself,
could hear her grumbling all the way down the
stairs.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stanley lost no time in answering the summons,
though Mrs. Welsh had tried to persuade him to
refuse to come, or, at least, to postpone his visit
until the next day.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The lad’s in no shape to see you,” she said, over
the telephone, “but I had t’ promise t’ tell you, or
he’d ’a’ been climbin’ out o’ bed, an’ him scarce
able t’ stand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got to come then, ma’am,” said Stanley
politely, but with great positiveness. “I’ve got to
obey my superior officer. Besides, I’ve pretty near
got to see him, anyway. I was goin’ to come
around in the mornin’ myself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, come on then, an’ bad cess to ye!” said
Mary, and five minutes later he was at the door.
“Now don’t you go to excitin’ the lad,” she added,
before she let him in.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I won’t, ma’am,” Stanley promised meekly.
“I’ll be a reg’lar soothin’ syrup. It’ll do him good
to see me—it really will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh!” grunted Mary, “that’s more ’n it does
me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>But she let him in reluctantly, and led him upstairs
to Allan’s bedroom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll give you two ten minutes,” she announced,
and closed the door behind her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stanley, grinning, drew a chair up to the bedside
and sat down.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Something of a Tartar,” he observed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, bless her, where I’m concerned. She’s the
best woman on earth and the biggest hearted. Now,
what’s the news?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, sir,” said Stanley, crossing his legs deliberately,
“this big sensation sort of took people’s
minds off the strike, and the situation hasn’t been
watched as close as it might have been. I’ve had
to be away a good deal, attendin’ the hearin’ an’
lookin’ after things, and I kind of think some of
the strikers got at our men.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How could they do that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suspect one of my men of givin’ us the
double cross—I fired him to-day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But what makes you think the strikers got at
the men?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, three more pulled out yesterday without
waitin’ fer their pay, and I hear they joined the
brotherhood last night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan’s face cleared.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If that’s all!” he said. “I guess we can spare
three men. If no more than that leave us, it shows
the men are pretty well contented. Has Mr. Schofield
or Mr. Plumfield been here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” Stanley answered, “and from what I
hear, they ain’t likely to be. They’ve both got their
hands full. Somebody tried to set fire to the stock-yards
the other night and pretty near succeeded—in
fact, did start a lively blaze, but it was discovered
and put out before much damage was done—and
mighty lucky it was that the night wasn’t
a windy one. But ever since, Mr. Schofield has
had to patrol the whole approach to Cincinnati, a
matter of five or six miles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—and what about Mr. Plumfield?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Stanley, “the same night, one of
the track walkers happened to find a big dynamite
bomb on the Parkersburg bridge and dumped it
over into the river just in time. That means more
patrollin’ at that end.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But who did it? Who started the fire and who
placed the bomb?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You can search me! The strikers say it wasn’t
them, and the brotherhood is offering a reward of
a thousand dollars for the arrest and conviction of
the guilty parties. I guess, though, their money’s
in no danger,” Stanley added, with a grin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You mean you think the strikers did it?” asked
Allan, quickly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t suppose anybody’s doin’ it fer their
health.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But if that’s their game, what’s to prevent them
from blowing up a bridge or culvert somewhere out
on the line any time they want to? We can’t guard
the whole right of way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There ain’t a thing on earth to prevent them,”
answered Stanley, cheerfully. “You know as well
as I do, that there never is any thing to prevent
any tramp or bum or scoundrel blowin’ up a bridge
at any time—but they never do—at least, mighty
seldom, though to hear some of ’em talk, you’d
think all they wanted was half a chance t’ blow up
the whole world. So I don’t look for anything
of that sort now. In the first place, scoundrels of
that kind won’t operate far from a base of supplies,
which means a grog-shop. An’ in the second place,
they’ve got to operate in a mob, for they’re the
biggest cowards on earth—and that means a big
town. I take back what I said a while ago. I don’t
think the strikers put that bomb on the bridge—I
think it was some Russian or Italian anarchist
from the Parkersburg coal mines or steel works.
There’s plenty of ’em there. An’ I ain’t so dead
sure they started the stock-yards fire, either. I had
a talk with Simpson, their special delegate, yesterday,
and he seems to be a pretty decent sort of
feller. I really believe he’s tryin’ to prevent trouble,
and I could see that he was considerable down in
the mouth about the strike. I think he’s gittin’ cold
feet and would be glad to back out, if he could.
I figger it out this way—the brotherhood’s split
up. The old, conservative men, headed by Simpson,
want to avoid trouble; the young, hot-headed
ones, headed by Bassett, are sp’ilin’ for a fight.
And they’re roundin’ up all the toughs they can find
to help them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Allan, with a sigh of relief, “they
won’t be able to find many here to help them, and
that’s a blessing!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wouldn’t be too sure of that,” said Stanley;
“but I don’t think there’ll be any trouble here—not
for a few days, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A few days?” echoed Allan. “What do you
mean by that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I mean,” answered Stanley, slowly, “that I
don’t like the looks of things. There’s too many
strangers in town.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too many strangers?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—too many strangers. Why, the saloons
are full of the toughest lookin’ lot of men you ever
saw. Where’d they come from—that’s what I
want to know—and what’s their business—and
who’s payin’ for their whiskey?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t understand you yet, Stanley,” said Allan,
a little impatiently. “Tell me straight out
what you’re afraid of.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m afraid that them fellers are bein’ brought
in here to cause trouble,” answered Stanley, bluntly.
“And I believe that Bassett’s at the bottom of the
whole thing. And furthermore I believe he’s got
that little devil of a Hummel helpin’ him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hummel? Have you seen him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seen him! I guess not! If I did, I’d have
him behind the bars so quick ’twould make his head
swim. But I’ve got to have some more men, and
the trouble is that the more I get, the more danger
there is of gettin’ some strike sympathizers among
them. I think I’d better patrol the yards and track
clear through to the city limits.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So do I,” Allan agreed. “I’d keep everybody
out of the yards and off the right of way who hasn’t
business there. And if there’s any sign of trouble,
let me know at once.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will,” Stanley promised; “I’m mighty glad
to have somebody to talk things over with. I’ve
felt like I was goin’ to bust the last few days. And
I’m glad you’re gettin’ better.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you,” Allan answered. “It’s just a
question now of getting my strength back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, don’t you worry none; let me do that,”
and the detective took his leave, much to the satisfaction
of Mrs. Welsh, who had been fuming outside
the door for the last five minutes, without
daring to break in upon the conversation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now,” said Allan, cheerfully, when she
returned from showing Stanley out, “I wish you’d
call Tom Murray, our chief lineman, and tell him
I want my instrument put on a board, so that I
can use it here in bed. Of course,” he added, as
Mary frowned mutinously, “I could get up and
go over there to the table, but I thought maybe
you’d rather I stayed in bed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Mary grimly, “it’ll save us the
trouble o’ puttin’ you there after you’ve kilt yerself,”
but she went and summoned the lineman, and
in half an hour, the little instrument was removed
from the table to a board, and Allan was working
it with his left hand, for his right arm was
incapacitated by reason of the broken collar-bone.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ever since the day when he and Jim Anderson
had rigged up a little private line for the study of
telegraphy, he had kept an instrument in his room,
connected with headquarters, so that he could be
called at any hour of the night, without anyone else
in the house being disturbed. For he had long since
acquired that sixth sense of the telegrapher, which
responds to its call, even though its possessor may
be sound asleep, and awakens him much as an alarm
clock might.</p>

<p class='c013'>So now, with the instrument under his hand, he
first called up the offices and had a little chat with
the dispatcher who was looking after his work as
chief—work which was not exacting since traffic
was so light; and then, calling Cincinnati, he asked
for Mr. Schofield. But Mr. Schofield was out
somewhere, and Allan was forced to content himself
for the time being with the assurance of the
man who answered him that everything seemed to
be all right.</p>

<p class='c013'>He pushed the instrument away, at last, and lay
back on the pillow, wearier than he cared to confess,
realizing how far from strong he was. The
shock of his terrible experience was one from which
he would probably be long in completely recovering,
but he set his teeth and resolved that he would
not be chained to his bed an instant longer than
was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class='c013'>He dozed off, after a time, half-sleeping, half-waking,
and Mary, opening the door and glancing
in at him, closed it softly and went away. He
heard her and smiled to himself and sank deeper
among the pillows.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not exactly a dream that he had as he lay
there—it was rather a vision—a living over again
of the incidents of that terrible day—living them
over, though, calmly; looking at them from the
outside, as though they were happening to someone
else. He saw himself struck down in the empty
stable; saw his assailant stoop above him, and
finally, after reconnoitring to make sure he was
not observed, drag his victim to the house, in
through the back door, and up the stairs to a room
on the floor above.</p>

<p class='c013'>He saw himself lying there unconscious, and
fear gripped his heart lest he might die there without
awaking; but the still figure stirred presently,
and opened its eyes. In the cellar beneath the
house, he could see a dim shape moving about,
illumined only by the light of a dirty lantern. It
was gathering a pile of rubbish together and adding
to it some rotten boards which it tore from
some shelving in one corner. Then the figure
mounted to the ground floor and collected a similar
heap there; then to the floor above, where it entered
the room in which he lay. He heard himself
talking to it, questioning it, heard its savage responses;
then he saw it go out and shut the door
and proceed to another room near by where five
figures lay bound upon the floor. They cursed it,
railed at it, implored it; but the fiend only laughed
sardonically and left them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then it descended leisurely to the floor below,
and from a cupboard produced some scraps of food,
which it proceeded to consume, after which it returned
to the stable, extinguished the lantern, lay
down upon its bed of straw and slept. How long
it slept, Allan could not tell, but at last it arose,
gathered the straw under one arm, and with the
lantern swinging from the other hand, returned to
the house. A portion of the straw was added to the
pile of rubbish in the cellar, and the rest of it to
the pile on the floor above. Then, the idiot opened
the lantern and poured over the pile the kerosene
which remained in it. Finally, with a devilish leer,
he struck a match and touched it to the straw.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a moment he sat feeding the flames carefully,
his face more demoniac than ever in the red
shadows which danced over it. Then, closing the
door, he proceeded to the cellar and set fire to the
rubbish there, and, finally, left the house and sat
down on a little hummock of earth outside. Allan
watched the flame grow and grow, the straw throwing
off a dense cloud of smoke as it burned; he
saw himself awaken, crawl to the door, along the
hall, to the stairs; saw himself pitch headforemost
through the darkness—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mamie!” he cried. “Mamie!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And he started awake to find Mamie’s arms about
him, and her dear face above him—</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>F<span class='sc'>or</span> an instant, Mamie bent above him, gazing
down at him, her face very tender; then she made
as though to draw away, but Allan threw his arm
about her and held her tight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it a dream?” he asked, “or is it really you,
Mamie?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, it isn’t a dream,” she answered, laughing.</p>

<p class='c013'>He drew a deep breath of relief as he looked up
at her, and then glanced about the familiar room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve dreamed so many times,” he said, “and
always you were bending over me—a sort of
guardian angel—‘guarding me, out of all the
world.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>Her colour heightened and her eyes grew bright.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s sweet of you to say that,” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you’re sure I’m not dreaming?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No—but you were; you were crying out—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—I thought I was still in that old stone
house. And I was crying for you, Mamie!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, for you—just as I have done a dozen
times before.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He stopped for an instant and gazed up into her
eyes, and his lips were trembling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you know why, Mamie?” he asked, at last.
“Can’t you guess why?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Something in his face brought the hot colour to
her cheeks, and she struggled to free herself from
his arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me go, Allan,” she pleaded. “You
mustn’t—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not yet. Not just for a moment. Do you
know what you are to me, Mamie? The dearest
thing in life! And I’m going to kiss you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no!” she cried. “Allan—”</p>

<p class='c013'>But he drew her lips down to his—such tender
lips they were, so sweet, so dewy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I’m going to marry you as soon as I get
well,” he announced, his cheek against hers. “And
we’ll live happy ever after, like the prince and princess
in the fairy tale. That is, of course, provided
the princess is agreeable.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She drew a quick, startled breath, and lay still
for a moment, warm against his heart; then she
drew his hands away, raised herself and looked
down at him with shining eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you mean it, Allan?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mean it? I mean it as I never meant anything
else. Put that little ear of yours down to my lips,
Mamie. I want to tell you something.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?” asked Mamie, her eyes luminous.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put your ear down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And Mamie bent a pink ear to his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I love you!” he whispered into it, and kissed it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again a quick breath shook that gentle bosom—a
breath of sheerest ecstasy—then, with a quick
movement, Mamie turned her head and laid her lips
to his.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I you!” she said. “And, oh, Allan, you
have made me happy!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing to what I am.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes,” she contradicted, seriously. “Much
happier. You see, I never thought that you—that
I—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, go on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I never thought that I was good enough.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good enough! You’re a thousand times too
good. That’s what worries me, Mamie.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I—I thought maybe, after you were married,
you—you’d let me keep house for you, or something
of that sort, so that I could see you—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I won’t listen!” cried Allan, and stopped her
lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, but you must,” she said, freeing herself,
“because I want you to know. I would have been
quite happy doing that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor little Cinderella!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the Prince has come, and the slipper fits.
I shall always believe in fairy tales, after this,” she
added, her eyes shining, “because I know one that’s
come true.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They were silent for a moment, too full of their
new happiness for any need of words. Then she
snuggled her cheek close to his.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When did you begin to love me, Allan?” she
whispered, shyly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That day when I picked you up from in front
of the locomotive.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seriously, Allan; tell me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know,” he said, drawing back so that
he could see her rosy, tender face. “I started long
before I knew it—away back when you were a
little girl, I guess. I can see now how it grew and
grew and made its foundation more and more secure,
so that there was no shaking it; but I never
woke to it till that night I came home from Cincinnati
and you met me at the door. Then it struck
me all of a sudden, and it was all I could do to
keep from taking you in my arms—”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mamie gave a delighted little wiggle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I knew it!” she said. “I saw it—and—I’m
ashamed to confess it, Allan!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To confess what?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How badly I wanted you to—and how I tried
to make you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He laughed delightedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Really? Why, you little siren!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; but then, you know, I’d loved you much
longer than you had me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How much longer?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, ages longer; since that very first time, I
think. You know, I kissed you then.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I seem to remember something of the
sort.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Only, of course, at first,” she added, “I didn’t
think about your loving anybody else, or care.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You were afraid of that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You did, you know,” she said, accusingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not really, Mamie,” he protested, earnestly.
“Not like this—not in the least like this. Betty
Heywood was right when she said I was never in
love with her—it was with girls in general, but
not with her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know that that makes it any better,”
pouted Mamie.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes, it does; it isn’t in the least like being
in love with an individual. Mamie,” he asked,
suddenly, “I’ve never been able to understand.
What was it led you to me out there in that old
house?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My love,” she answered, promptly. “I don’t
think it the least strange, Allan. When you fell
down the stairs, you called me and I heard. How
could I have helped but hear?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; I suppose that was it,” he agreed, holding
her closer. “But it was wonderful just the same.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think anything else would have been wonderful.
It seems to me the most natural thing in the
world. I shall always hear, when you call me,
Allan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will you? Well, we’ll see. When are we
going to get married, Mamie?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh,” she said, and pulled herself away, and sat
upright, with flaming cheeks. “Not for a long
time—two years, anyway. You know, I’m only
seventeen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You thought that was a great age, not so very
long ago.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It doesn’t seem so great now—and since we
know we love each other, what does anything else
matter?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It matters a good deal. I’ll see about it just
as soon as I can get about.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you know,” she said, looking down at him
critically, “I believe you’re something of a
tyrant?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know I am,” he laughed, joyously; “I’m a
good deal of a tyrant. You’ll see!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Maybe I won’t marry you after all!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m not afraid. You’re dying for me—come
now, own up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>For an instant Mamie hesitated—the traditions
of her sex held her back. Then she flung herself
forward upon him and hugged him tight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am—I am,” she cried. “And it shall be
whenever you say, Allan!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And just then, Mary opened the door and looked
in.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mamie,” she began, and then stopped astonished
at the sight that met her eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Mamie had rushed to her and thrown her
arms around her neck and was holding her tight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, mummy, mummy!” she cried. “Guess!
You could never guess! Allan—we’re—”</p>

<p class='c013'>She stopped, stammering with sheer joy, and
Mary, taking her by the shoulders, held her off and
looked at her—at the starry eyes, at the blushing
cheeks, at the smiling lips; and then, for the first
time in her life, Mary Welsh quite gave way, collapsed
into a chair, threw her apron over her head
and sobbed as though her heart would break.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, mummy!” cried Mamie.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s nothin’! It’s nothin’!” sobbed that good
woman. “Let—let me be—don’t you see it’s for
joy, you foolish children,” and the storm passing
as quickly as it had come, she pulled her apron down
again, and kissed them both. “It’s the happiest
day of my life—Oh, I have hoped for it and
prayed for it—but I never thought—wait till I
tell Jack! An’ him out on th’ road an’ not comin’
back till t’morrer night! Mamie,” she added, eyeing
her offspring sternly, “do you know where you
ought t’ be? You ought t’ be down on your knees
thankin’ heaven fer such a man—the best an’
kindest on God’s green earth!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, come!” protested Allan, laughing. “No,
he’s not; not by a good deal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Mary did not heed him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ if ever,” she continued, “you give him
cause for sorrow or misgivin’, you’ll answer to me,
young lady—that you will!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And then, suddenly relenting, she caught Mamie
to her and kissed her again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ now I guess I’d better take you away,”
she added. “You’ll be excitin’ the boy too much.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, nonsense!” Allan cried. “Exciting me,
indeed! Don’t you see I’m a hundred per cent. better—there
never was such medicine. Take her
away, and I’ll go into a decline right off!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll leave her, then,” said Mary; “but
mind you take your medicine!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And she went out and closed the door after her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mamie came back and sat down by the bedside.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got a lot to learn, you know, Allan,” she
began seriously. “There’s the cooking—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, you’re a splendid cook.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not nearly so good as mummy. And I
wouldn’t have you miss her cooking.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, I won’t miss anything, you little goose,
if I have you. I’ll have to look for a house.
There’s a new one going up right back on Second
street—it looks pretty nice—”</p>

<p class='c013'>But just then, his instrument began to call him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s Mr. Schofield,” he said, and answered,
as Mamie handed the board up to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How are you?” was the first question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Coming along fine,” Allan answered. “Will
be out in a day or two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s great. We need you. Things here are
in pretty bad shape, but I’m hoping they will calm
down. All the trouble is caused by a lot of loafers,
and I’m trying to find out who it is that’s behind
them. You heard about the fire at the stock-yards?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Stanley told me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ve got the men who did that, and intend
to put them through, but I’m sure there’s somebody
back of them, and we’re trying to get a confession.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you think it’s the strikers?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; or if it is, it’s a gang of the less scrupulous
ones.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s what Stanley thinks. He says Bassett’s
at the head of it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s a good idea—worth working on, anyway.
Suppose you tell Stanley to have one of his
best men keep an eye on Bassett. If he starts for
Cincinnati, let me know and I’ll have him shadowed
at this end. How are things at Wadsworth?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stanley was just here and reported everything
quiet. He says he’s worried, though, by a lot of
tough-looking strangers who have showed up recently
in the depot saloons.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, don’t take any chances. Swear in all the
deputies you need. And keep everybody out of the
yards.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve already ordered that. Have we men
enough to run the trains?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re a little short, but there’s another squad
coming on from the east to-night. There have been
a lot here looking for jobs, but I’m afraid to hire
them. Don’t hire anybody at Wadsworth, unless
you’re sure of them. We must hold our men together.
I think the strikers are getting tired and
another week will see the end of it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope so.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The only thing I’m afraid of and want to guard
against is a flare-up at the end. And that’s what
I want you to watch for and try to prevent. Some
of the young fire-eaters may feel so sore when they
know they’ve lost the strike that they’ll try to take
it out on us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right; and I’ll get out myself just as soon
as I can.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take your time—I don’t want you to get a
relapse. I’ve heard all about that adventure of
yours. I’ll tell you what I think about it when I
see you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I didn’t do anything. It was Jack Welsh and
Reddy Magraw.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve heard about them, too. And what’s this
story about a young damsel leading the rescuers?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was Welsh’s daughter.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I want to meet her when I get back to Wadsworth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right; I’ll introduce you,” and Allan
chuckled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it, Allan?” asked Mamie. “I know
you’re saying something about me by the way
you’re laughing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Allan silenced her with a wave of the hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know what you ought to do,” added Mr.
Schofield.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Marry her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll think about it,” answered Allan, chuckling
again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Keep me posted about Bassett.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-bye,” clicked Allan, and pushed the instrument
away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see I’ll have to learn telegraphy,” said Mamie.
“I can’t have you talking about me to people right
before me and me not understanding a word of it!
What was he saying?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He said he wanted to meet the heroine.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; and what else?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He said it was up to me to marry her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what did you tell him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I told him she was willing, but I hadn’t made
up my mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Mamie, reflectively, looking sternly
at his laughing face, “I’ll certainly have to learn
telegraphy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s only three words you need know,” said
Allan. “Here they are,” and, finger on key, he
clicked off slowly, .. — .. ...-. .. ..&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ..-</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what do they mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I love you,’” he answered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think I like them better spoken,” said Mamie;
“and I suppose I’ll have to forgive you.”</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Joy is a great restorer, and the next twenty-four
hours worked a big improvement in Allan’s condition.
The wound on his head was healing nicely,
and he had almost recovered from the weakness
which the loss of blood had occasioned. A broken
collar-bone is at no time a very dangerous injury,
and in the case of this young and vigorous fellow
it had already begun to knit, though, of course, his
shoulder would stay in splints for a fortnight yet.
From the general shock which he had suffered, his
strong young body rallied quickly, and on the afternoon
of the day following the conversation just recorded,
the doctor announced that he might leave
his bed and sit up a while.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And to-morrow, doctor,” Allan added, “I’m
going down to the office.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll see,” said the doctor, laughing. “I don’t
say you sha’n’t go; but I hope it won’t be necessary.
I’d like to keep you quiet here for a day or
two yet—you’ll gain by it in the end.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was in his chair that Stanley found him when
he came to make his report.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No special developments,” he said. “A few
more strangers, but none of them has offered to
give any trouble. I got the police to railroad a few
of them out of town. I think the mayor’s seein’
a light. You know, this strike hasn’t been conducted
any too well—or maybe it was because
our side of it has been handled right—but the
strikers are sort of losin’ heart. Bassett’s made a
blamed fool of himself since it started. He’s been
drunk most of the time, and had a fight last night,
at the lodge meetin’ with Jim Adams, one of the
oldest engineers on the road. You know he’s always
had a grudge ag’in Adams, anyway—he’s
tried t’ do fer him afore this.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Allan. “We’ve always suspected he
tried to send him through the Jones Run bridge
by running past it that night it was on fire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t doubt he did,” said Stanley. “Anyway,
he got white-hot last night. I hear that even the
special delegate sided ag’in him, and told him that
if it happened ag’in, he’d be fired from the brotherhood.
And I hear that Bassett’s drunker’n ever to-day,
and threatens t’ cause more trouble at the
meetin’ to-night. If he does, I think the jig’s up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we won’t count on it. Have you got
enough men to patrol the yards thoroughly?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got thirty—that ought to be enough. I’ve
got a string all around the yards. Nobody can git
in who can’t show his business.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not even after night?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, o’ course, my men ain’t owls, but they’ll
keep open what eyes they’ve got.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are the trains moving all right?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the dot—and another thing—I hear that
the conductors have definitely refused to join the
strike. I guess they see which way the wind’s
blowin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m glad of that—if all the brotherhoods were
as sensible.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, they’ll make you pay fer it the next time
they have a grievance,” said Stanley, with a grin.
“They’ll remind you how they stood by you, and
so will the brakemen.”</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Evening came, and with it, Jack. Allan heard
him coming up the stairs, and called to him to come
in before he had time to knock.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come in and sit down,” said Allan. “How’s
everything out on the line?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Foine as silk. An’ it certainly does me good
t’ see you settin’ up. That doctor’s all right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, it wasn’t the doctor,” cried Allan. “Jack,
don’t you know—didn’t they tell you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack’s honest face was a-gleam, as he took Allan’s
outstretched hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” he said, “they told me. An’ it’s a happy
man I am, Allan West—happier ’n I ever thought
I could be!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And it’s a happy man I am, Jack Welsh,” said
Allan. “You can trust her to me, Jack,” he added,
earnestly. “I’ll be good to her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t I know it, boy! It’s a lucky girl she is—an’
a lucky family. It’s—it’s—Allan, boy,
if I’d thought an’ thought, I couldn’ ’a’ thought of
anything that would make me happier. Who’s
that?” he added, as a heavy step sounded on the
stair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith, an’ it’s Reddy Magraw!” cried a familiar
voice. “Your old woman was jest tellin’ me,
Jack, when I come in t’ ask after th’ boy, there—tellin’
me about him an’ Mamie. An’ I jest couldn’t
go away without seein’ both of you. Jack Welsh,”
he added, sternly, “what have ye got t’ say?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’. I’m too full t’ say anything, Reddy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, then, I’ll say it fer ye,” said Reddy;
“an’ it’s this. I’d rather have a darter of mine
wife to that boy there than t’ the king of England.
Yes, an’ if I had a dozen darters, an’ he wanted
’em, I’d say take ’em—an’ I’d be sorry I hadn’t
more!”</p>

  <h2 id='ch25' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXV <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>THE DOWNFALL OF BASSETT</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>S<span class='sc'>ince</span> the beginning of the strike, the engineers’
headquarters had remained open continually, and,
in addition to the informal meetings during the day,
a formal meeting was held every evening to discuss
the situation. These meetings, which the firemen
also attended, had started out peacefully enough,
but two factions had soon developed, one led by
Simpson, the special delegate, and the other by
Rafe Bassett. The feeling between these factions
had steadily increased in bitterness, and had culminated
the evening before, as Stanley had reported
to Allan, in an assault by Bassett on one of the oldest
engineers in the road’s employ.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simpson, early recognizing Bassett’s violent and
quarrelsome disposition, had foreseen this development,
and had lost no opportunity to strengthen
himself with the conservative element and to gain
its confidence. He had worked wisely and well,
and the consequence was that Bassett’s following
had melted away so rapidly that Simpson at last
felt himself strong enough to administer a stinging
warning to the offender.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this victory, Simpson had been greatly aided
by the course of events. Many of the engineers had
opposed the strike at the outset, but had been over-borne
by the younger element; as the days passed,
more and more, under Simpson’s careful guidance,
had come to acknowledge that the strike was a mistake
and that public opinion was turning against
them. The older men were especially outspoken in
their expressions of regret, and while many of the
younger men kept up a semblance of contentment,
it was plainly to be seen that they, too, were growing
uneasy. Almost the only one who was still
openly pleased with the strike was Bassett himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>The discontent with the situation had found expression
on the floor of the lodge the night before,
when Jim Adams had suggested that a committee
be appointed to wait upon the officials of the road,
and see whether an agreement to end the strike
could not be reached. It was this suggestion which
had led to Bassett’s assault and to the subsequent
warning and reprimand which Simpson had given
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>In consequence of all this, everyone felt that affairs
were reaching a crisis, and the lodge room
was even more crowded than usual, this evening,
as the hour for the meeting approached. The men
gathered in little groups and discussed in low tones
the scene of the evening before. It was evident
that a new spirit had come over the men, and more
than one stated that it was his intention to approve
the suggestion made by Adams the night before,
and that he would not allow Rafe Bassett to roar
him down. But none of them cared to provoke
unnecessarily Bassett’s open enmity, for he was universally
recognized as a dangerous man, and when,
at last, he swaggered into the room, plainly under
the influence of liquor, an uneasy silence fell upon
the crowd.</p>

<p class='c013'>The meeting was called to order, and Simpson
arose to make a few announcements. He waited
until Bassett, evidently spoiling for a fight, swaggered
noisily to a chair near the stage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is no change in the situation,” he began.
“The strike is progressing quietly—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too blame quietly,” Bassett broke in. “You’d
think we was a lot o’ Sunday school kids by the
way we set around with our hands folded, actin’ like
sugar wouldn’t melt in our—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Order! Order!” called the chairman, rapping
with his gavel, and Bassett subsided, growling, into
his chair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As I was saying,” Simpson proceeded calmly,
“the strike is progressing quietly. One good piece
of news I have—the fellows who tried to set fire
to the stock-yards have been arrested and turned
out to be a couple of saloon bums, who never
worked on a railroad, or anywhere else, and of
course never belonged to the brotherhood. I’m
mighty glad that this effectually clears the brotherhood
of any suspicion of being implicated in the
affair.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you know they’re the ones?” Bassett
demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I understand they have confessed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Been given the third degree, I guess. Who’s
defendin’ ’em?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know, nor care. The brotherhood certainly
won’t defend them. If they haven’t any
money, counsel for them will be appointed by the
court, I suppose, in the usual way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And they’ll be railroaded to the pen, also in the
usual way,” sneered Bassett. “It makes me sick
the way we go back on our friends.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re not our friends,” said Simpson,
sharply. “They’re the worst enemies we’ve got.
We’re in no way responsible for them nor indebted
to them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ain’t we?” and Bassett was on his feet again.
“Where’d they git the whiskey they tanked up
on afore they tackled the job? Who give it to
them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know—some saloon-keeper, probably.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, it wasn’t no saloon-keeper,” cried Bassett,
“an’ you know it. What would a saloon-keeper
be givin’ away good whiskey fer? An’ more’n
that, where’d they git the twenty dollars that was
found on each of ’em? Did a saloon-keeper give
’em that, too?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Since you seem to know so much about it,”
said Simpson, with ominous calmness, “suppose
you tell us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, I <i>will</i> tell you!” yelled Bassett, his
self-control suddenly slipping from him. “Though
I won’t be tellin’ you no news, for all your standin’
there lookin’ so goody-good. It’s sneaks like you
an’ Jim Adams, what want t’ go crawlin’ back
lickin’ the boots of the railroad, that disgusts me
with the brotherhood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sneak yourself!” cried Adams, jumping to his
feet and starting for Bassett, but two of his friends
seized him and held him back.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let him come on!” shouted Bassett, fairly
purple. “I’ll fix him this time—I’ve been wantin’
to fer years. Let him come on!”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Adams was pulled panting back into his
chair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you hear what he said?” he demanded of
those about him. “Did you hear what he said?
He as good as admitted he tried to do fer me that
night at Jones Run bridge!”</p>

<p class='c013'>But they weren’t listening to him; they were
listening to Bassett, who, fairly livid with rage, had
turned back to Simpson.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” he shouted, “goody-goody sneaks like
you an’ Adams—standin’ there lettin’ on you don’t
know who it was put them poor devils up to firin’
the stock-yards!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve already asked you to tell me,” repeated
Simpson, quietly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was two members of this lodge!” yelled Bassett,
quite beside himself. “It was two members
of this lodge what give the whiskey an’ the cash,
an’ they knowed what they was doin’, too!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The place was in an uproar; angry voices demanded
the names of the offending members, denials
were shouted across the room, fists were shaken;
but the chairman finally succeeded in beating down
the din until Simpson’s voice could be heard again.
His face was flushed and there was a dangerous
light in his eyes as he turned to Bassett, who had
subsided into his seat again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Bassett,” he began, “you have said too
much not to say more. I demand the names of
those two men.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Bassett had already said more than he had
intended to say, and heartily regretted his hasty
tongue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I ain’t no tale-bearer,” he protested. “I know
what I know; but it don’t go no furder.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You refuse to tell?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then,” said Simpson, firmly, “by virtue of the
authority vested in me by the Grand Lodge, I suspend
you from membership in the brotherhood until
a hearing of this case can be had.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What!” yelled Bassett, on his feet again, his
face purple. “Suspend me! Why, you—you
snake! Boys,” he shouted, “do you stand fer this?”
It’s Nixon over ag’in! Oh, they’re all rotten! I
tell you those fellers layin’ in jail down at Cincinnati
ought t’ be looked after by the brotherhood—I
tell you why—I speak as a man to men—I don’t
believe in lettin’ some corporation-owned Hamilton
County judge railroad them to the pen. It ain’t
right, an’ every man of you knows it ain’t right.
But I ain’t no informer—I won’t say nothin’ more—an’
because I won’t, this here whipper-snapper
from headquarters says he’ll suspend me. Boys, I
tell you the Grand Lodge is rotten through an’
through. It’s owned by the railroads. It’s time
we turned the scoundrels out!”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a good talk, effectively delivered, and it
carried some of the younger men with it, as was
shown by the subdued growl which ran around the
room. Not so very long before, it would have carried
the whole lodge with it, but sentiment had
changed. Simpson, who had gone through just
such scenes before, never turned a hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I want to say to you,” he said, “that the
Grand Lodge is devoted to you, and you know it—deep
down in your hearts, you know it. Yes, and
I want to add that I think we made a mistake in
consenting to this strike, and in my opinion the
sooner we call it off the better. As to those fellows
at Cincinnati, so far from defending them, the
brotherhood has promised to pay, and will pay, a
reward of five hundred dollars upon their conviction,
and it will pay the same reward for the conviction
of the scoundrel who tried to dynamite the
bridge at Parkersburg.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As for this man,” he added, pointing to Bassett,
“he is no longer a member of the brotherhood
and will not be until he is reinstated—and if that
ever happens, which I don’t believe, it will certainly
be against my advice. As this lodge has further
business to transact, I would therefore ask Mr.
Bassett to retire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Retire yourself!” shouted Bassett, now thoroughly
enraged. “If you want me out, you’ll have
to put me out, an’ I’d like to see you do it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I’ll do it, if necessary,” retorted Simpson.
“But before you go, I want to say one thing to you
for all these men to hear. It’s blackguards like you
who bring discredit upon the brotherhood and upon
unionism generally—blackguards who are always
trying to get something they don’t deserve, and to
evade something they do deserve. It’s blackguards
like you who think the union cause is helped by
violence, and who want every strike to be accompanied
by violence. Now, apart from any consideration
of right or wrong—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is this, a sermon?” demanded Bassett,
looking around with a raucous laugh—but it found
no echo.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” retorted Simpson; “and a sermon you’ll
do well to listen to. Apart from any consideration
of right or wrong, nothing hurts our cause like
violence—I think we’ve found that out—and the
fellow who advocates violence or assists in it is an
enemy and not a friend. And I haven’t the slightest
doubt,” he added, wheeling upon Bassett, “that it
was this fellow here who was responsible for that
fire at the stock-yards.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Bassett, his face white and drawn with passion,
could only sputter inarticulately for a moment.
Then, by a mighty effort, he regained control of
himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re pipin’ a different tune,” he sneered,
“from what you did when you first come down
here. Why? Have you been seen, like Nixon was?
Have you got a wad of railroad money in your
pocket?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sergeant-at-arms,” called Simpson, “this fellow
is not a member of this lodge. Remove him,
so that the meeting can proceed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Simpson sat down and awaited the event
with serene confidence. For, as has been stated,
he had been in just such a position more than once
before, and he had planned carefully to meet this
crisis. The sergeant-at-arms, instructed beforehand
in his duties, summoned two assistants and advanced
upon Bassett. For a moment, it was evident
that that individual meditated resistance; then,
as he sized up the three stalwart men confronting
him, he realized the futility of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” he said; “I’ll go. But don’t put
your hands on me—I won’t stand that. An’ I
just want to say one thing: you’ll all of you regret
this night’s work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And catching up his overcoat, he followed the
sergeant-at-arms to the door, which closed after
him a moment later.</p>

<p class='c013'>The night’s experience had sobered him, but
nevertheless he reeled slightly as he went down the
stairs—not with intoxication, but with a kind of
vertigo of rage. He paused at the foot of the
stairs to recover himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They framed it up on me!” he muttered to
himself. “The hounds! To think of their framin’
it up on me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And he got out his handkerchief and mopped his
forehead with shaking hand. Then, entering the
saloon on the ground floor of the building, he asked
for two quart bottles of whiskey.</p>

<p class='c013'>The bartender, an old acquaintance, ventured to
protest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look here, Rafe,” he said, “you’re goin’ it too
strong. Better let up a little, old man.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, this ain’t fer me,” answered Bassett, laughing
grimly. “I’m givin’ a little blow-out to-night.
This is fer the company,” and putting a bottle in
each coat-pocket, he hurried from the place.</p>

<p class='c013'>The bartender gazed after him speculatively, for
there was a strangeness in his manner, a sort of
menace, as of a man who has thrown down the
gauntlet to society, regardless of the consequences,
but other customers demanded attention, and the
bartender soon forgot all about the incident. Could
he have followed Bassett, he would have been more
and more surprised; for the latter’s path did not
lead him home, nor to any place suggestive of a
social function. Instead, he turned down the nearest
alley, came out upon the railroad track and followed
it toward the river. Once he passed a track-walker,
but the latter did not recognize the dark
figure apparently hurrying toward home.</p>

<p class='c013'>The road ran past back yards, from which an
occasional dog saluted him, crossed a street at an
angle, skirted a row of tumble-down brick buildings,
and then emerged upon the river bank, which
it skirted for perhaps half a mile. Upon this bank,
in the days when municipal sanitation was not what
it now is, a number of slaughter-houses had been
built, because of the convenience of running their
refuse into the river. This had been stopped some
years before, and the buildings, already decrepit and
decayed, had fallen into a still more disreputable
condition.</p>

<p class='c013'>A high board fence surrounded the little stretch
of ground in front of them, and before this Bassett
paused, groped an instant, pulled aside a loose board
and slipped through. He let the board slide into
place behind him, crossed the dirty yard, and, producing
a key from his pocket, applied it to the lock
of the first door he came to. An instant later, he
had opened the door and entered.</p>

<p class='c013'>An odour incredibly foul and overpowering
greeted him, and he paused to catch his breath, as
it were. Then, groping his way forward along the
wall, he came to another door, which he opened.
Carefully closing it behind him, he struck a match.
Its glow revealed a black pit yawning before him,
into which plunged a steep and narrow stair. On a
ledge at the top was a candle-end, and lighting this
and holding it before him, Bassett descended the
stair, which creaked and groaned ominously under
his weight. At the bottom he blew out his candle
and placed it carefully on the lowest step.</p>

<p class='c013'>He could hear the ripple of the river close at
hand, but no other sound, for he was at the bottom
of the shaft which led to the water’s edge. He apparently
knew the place well, for he felt his way
forward until his hands touched a board partition.
Upon this he rapped sharply three times and then,
after an interval, a fourth.</p>

<p class='c013'>Instantly there was a sharp click and a little door
swung open, disclosing a man holding a candle
above his head and peering out into the darkness—a
little, shrivelled man, with livid, pock-marked face
and venomous eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, Hummel,” said Bassett, and stepped
inside and drew the door shut after him.</p>

<div class='pbb'>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch26' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVI <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>NEMESIS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>T<span class='sc'>he</span> place which Bassett had entered was a
squalid little enclosure, eight or nine feet square,
with the floor of the slaughter-house for a roof,
rough slabs for walls, and the earth of the river
bank for a floor. A rude fireplace of loose bricks
had been built in one corner, the smoke from which
was conducted up through a stove-pipe into the
empty slaughter-house above. A little pile of coal,
stolen from a near-by coalyard, occupied one corner,
and a dirty bed, formed by some boards thrown
across two boxes, another. Three boxes took the
place of chairs and table, and another box nailed
against the wall, served as a cupboard. The floor
was littered with empty cans and whiskey bottles
and scraps of refuse, and was slippery and slimy
with dampness from the river.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hummel placed the candle on one of the boxes
and then turned to his visitor, his face more loathsome
than ever. Face, hands and clothing were
caked with dirt. His hands were trembling as
though with palsy, and it was evident that he was
on the verge of delirium tremens.</p>

<p class='c013'>Without waiting for him to speak, Bassett, seeing
his condition at a glance, drew from his pocket
one of the bottles he had just purchased, and held
it out to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hummel, with a low exclamation of relief and
joy, seized it, knocked off the head, and snatching
up a dirty tumbler, filled it from the bottle and
drained the last drop. Then he set bottle and glass
down beside him with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s better,” he said. “You ain’t been
treatin’ me right, Rafe. You oughtn’t to let me
run out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Run out!” Bassett repeated. “Good Lord!
I’ll have to start a distillery t’ keep you from runnin’
out! I never see a man who could swill whiskey
like you kin—a gallon a day ain’t nothin’!
Why, you’re a reg’lar tank, with no bottom, at
that!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Hummel glared at him evilly, then poured out
another glass full of the liquor and swallowed
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s that to you?” he demanded. “You
know what the bargain was—an’ I’m ready to do
my part whenever you say the word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ I’m ready t’ do mine,” declared Bassett,
and drew the other bottle from his pocket and set
it on the ground. “Is that enough fer to-night?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I guess so,” said Hummel, sullenly.
“But I’m gittin’ tired of settin’ here in this hogpen,
drinkin’ myself t’ death. I’ve got some little
spark of decency left in me, though you mayn’t
think it. Why don’t we do something?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll do something to-night!” said Bassett,
with sudden fury. “Where’s the gang?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’ve weakened,” said Hummel, glancing
sullenly at the other. “Since them fellers were
crimped at Cincinnati fer that stock-yards business,
they won’t do nothin’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They won’t, hey?” cried Bassett. “Then they
don’t git no pay. They’ve got all o’ my money
they’re goin’ t’ git!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They know that!” sneered Hummel. “It
wasn’t so awful much, anyway. They skipped out
to-night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Skipped out?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—caught a freight back to Cinci.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Bassett pondered this a moment, with knitted
brows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” he said, at last. “We don’t need
’em. But I didn’t think any friends o’ yourn would
be so white-livered.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They ain’t white-livered, but they don’t like
t’ git the double cross.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who give ’em the double cross?” demanded
Bassett, threateningly. “Do you mean me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” replied Hummel, avoiding his eye, “I
ain’t namin’ no names. But somebody peached on
them stock-yards fellers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It wasn’t me. Why, just because I stood up
fer ’em t’-night, I got fired out o’ the brotherhood
by that smooth snake of a Simpson.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got fired out, did you?” queried Hummel, his
eyes lighting with an evil glint of satisfaction.
“Then the jig’s up?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, it ain’t up—not by a good deal. Rafe
Bassett has got a lot o’ fight in him yet. But first
I’m goin’ t’ git even. Is everything ready?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—been ready fer three days.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kin we two carry it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kin carry it myself. It ain’t heavy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ you’re sure it’ll work?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I made it—an’ it ain’t the first I’ve made by
a blame sight.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” said Bassett, looking at his companion
with something like respect. “Come on, then,”
and he rose and buttoned his coat.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Hummel sat still. His eyes were burning
with a strange fire, and Bassett looked at him with
some uneasiness. He had never been quite sure of
Hummel; he regarded him a good deal as he might
have done a deadly snake which he was keeping
in captivity to use against an enemy, but always
with the feeling that the snake might at any time
turn against himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” he added, after a moment, “ain’t you
comin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not just yet,” answered Hummel, calmly. “I
want t’ talk t’ you a little, first. Set down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’d better be gittin’ along,” Bassett protested,
but he sat down nevertheless.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now,” proceeded Hummel, deliberately, “you
know after we pull this thing off, I’ll want to git
away, an’ git away quick. This won’t be a healthy
neighbourhood fer either of us. I don’t want t’
have t’ wait around fer you, an’ mebbe miss you,
at that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nobody wants you to,” broke in Bassett impatiently.
“What is it you’re drivin’ at, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m drivin’ at this,” said Hummel. “I want
my pay here an’ now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Bassett sat for a moment contemplating him with
hostile eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Half now an’ half afterwards,” he said, at last.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir!” Hummel objected positively. “Here
an’ now, all of it. Else I don’t go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But look here,” Bassett protested, “suppose I
do give you the money, how do I know you’ll do
your part?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Hummel, grimly, “I guess you’ll
have t’ trust me. But don’t be afeerd—I’ll do it,
an’ do it right!”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was nothing to do but yield—Bassett
recognized that plainly enough, for Hummel, in his
present mood, was not to be argued with; besides,
his demand was reasonable enough. The liquor
was turning him into a demon who would stop
at nothing—the very thing which Bassett had
counted on it doing—and he was anxious to get
the plot under way before the inevitable reaction
set in. So, reluctantly enough, for it represented
the last not only of his savings but of his credit,
Bassett put his hand in his pocket, drew out his
wallet and slowly counted five ten-dollar bills into
Hummel’s outstretched hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There,” he said, with an oath, “I hope you’re
satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Hummel folded the bills up and thrust them
into an inside pocket.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am,” he said; “an’ I’m ready whenever you
are. But don’t think I’m doin’ this job fer this
dirty money. I ain’t. I’ve got t’ have this t’ make
my getaway, but I’m doin’ this t’ git even with that
little snake of a chief dispatcher, an’ t’ show these
corporations that there’s some people will stand up
fer their rights. I’m an anarchist, I am,” he continued,
growing more and more excited from minute
to minute. “I’m—”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Bassett had had enough of it, and his hand
closed savagely upon the other’s arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Cut it out!” he cried. “Don’t waste time
in poppin’ off—do somethin’. Where’s the
stuff?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here it is,” said Hummel, and sprang toward
the pile of coal in one corner. Clearing it away,
he brought to light a box perhaps a foot square.
He snapped open the lid, and took out a small tube
about nine inches in length. “That’s a little one
fer me, in case I need it,” he said, his eyes gleaming,
and thrust it into his pocket. “They’ll never
take me alive.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Hummel,” protested Bassett, his face
considerably paler than usual, “don’t you do nothin’
foolish. That’s dangerous stuff to have around
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I know how t’ handle it! Better take a
drink t’ keep up your nerve—you’ll need it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Bassett, whose hands were shaking slightly, silently
acknowledged the wisdom of the advice and
poured himself out a drink. Hummel waited till
he had finished, then poured the remainder of the
contents of the bottle into the glass, and drained it,
throwing the empty bottle to join the others on
the floor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You go ahead,” he said, “an’ wait fer me
under the lower end of the freight platform. I’ll
bring the stuff. We mustn’t be seen together.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” Bassett assented, glad to get away
from his dangerous neighbourhood, and he went
out, closing the door after him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hummel picked up the full bottle of whiskey,
and getting out a knife which had a corkscrew attachment,
drew the cork. Then he replaced it
lightly and put the bottle in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll need that,” he said to himself, and then,
blowing out the candle, he left the room and groped
his way up the stairs and out of the slaughter-house,
the mysterious box under his arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>He chose an alley which led away from the track,
and then another which crossed it at right angles,
and at the end of five minutes came out opposite
the freight-house. He had met no one, for the
night was dark and windy, with a dash of rain now
and then. He stood peering across the street at
the freight-house, until he saw a guard pass the
circle of light at the door and disappear around the
corner of the building. Then, tucking the box
more firmly under his arm, he crossed the street
like a shadow and disappeared beneath the platform.
He worked his way along to the end of it,
and nearly fell over Bassett, who was sitting under
the platform there awaiting him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For God’s sake, man, be careful!” Bassett
whispered hoarsely, a cold sweat breaking out upon
him at thought of what would happen if Hummel
fell.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I’m all right,” retorted Hummel, easily,
and sat down beside the other, placing the box
beside him. “Suppose I just drop this little feller
right here,” he went on, pensively, taking the small
tube from his pocket. “That’ll set off the big one,
too, an’ I reckon there’d be considerable of a hole,
without so much as a grease-spot left of you an’
me. What d’ you say to a jump into the next
world, Rafe? We ain’t been much of a success
in this one!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, see here, Hummel,” protested Bassett,
savagely, the cold chills chasing each other up and
down his spine, for he was not sure but that Hummel,
in his desperate mood, was capable of carrying
out his threat, “drop that nonsense. I’ve
paid you t’ do certain work, an’ you’re goin’ t’ do
it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” agreed the other, shortly. “I’ll
plant the mine—”</p>

<p class='c013'>He ceased abruptly as he heard the guard’s footsteps
on the platform overhead; but the sound
passed without pausing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got a fuse that burns fifteen minutes—plenty
of time for a getaway. Good-bye, if I don’t
see you again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-bye,” answered Bassett. “But I’ll see
you again all right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He listened while the other worked his way forward
under the platform toward the freight-shed,
and then, when the sound had died away, he stuck
his head out from under the platform and looked
around. The wind had risen and was singing
through the wires overhead.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What a night fer a fire!” he muttered. “I’ve
got time—fifteen minutes, anyway—I’ll make a
try fer it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>A string of freight cars was drawn up beside the
platform, and Bassett, crawling cautiously forth,
peered into them, one after another. Some were
empty, some were half-loaded, some were sealed
ready to be sent east or west. Once he heard footsteps
approaching and skulked beneath a car until
they passed. Then he continued his quest, and at
last, with a chuckle of satisfaction, found what he
was looking for, yet scarcely expected to find—a
car half-filled with barrels of oil. Evidently the
work of unloading had been uncompleted at nightfall
and the car had been left with the door only
half-closed.</p>

<p class='c013'>After a moment’s pause, to make certain that
he was not observed, Bassett drew himself up into
the car, then, grasping the edge of the door, he
pulled it shut. Secure from observation, he struck
a match, and, shading it with his hand, looked
around. The barrels had been removed from the
middle of the car, but were still stacked at each end.
They were dripping with oil and little puddles
stood upon the floor. Evidently the touch of a
match would set the whole car aflame, and would
start a fire which no water would extinguish.
There were cars to right and left—and with that
wind! He chuckled again as he thought of the
result. He would show them whether Rafe Bassett
was to be treated like a dog—insulted, kicked
out—</p>

<p class='c013'>He carefully extinguished the match, and then,
after a moment’s thought, drew a newspaper from
his pocket, and, unfolding it, twisted it into a long
fuse. Then, lighting another match, he dabbled
one end of the paper in a puddle of oil and pressed
it down with his foot until it was sticking to the
floor of the car. So intent was he on this that he
failed to note that the match had burnt down to
his fingers, and as the flame touched him, he involuntarily
dropped it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Instantly there was a flash and a roar and the
whole car seemed to burst into flame. Shielding
his face with one arm, Bassett sprang to the door
and tried to push it back, but he jammed it in his
haste and could not move it. He saw his trousers
afire and stopped to beat out the flame; his trousers
caught again—his coat—his hat—his hair—</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he understood, and with a shrill scream of
terror turned again to the door, clawing at it,
scratching at it, tearing at it like a wild beast. Another
moment, and the flames were swirling about
him—another moment and he could feel his flesh
crisping under their white-hot touch; another moment—and
the door rolled back and he fell forward
out of the car, afire from head to foot.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch27' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVII <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>THE BOMB</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>T<span class='sc'>he</span> watchman in the upper yards, passing wearily
on his rounds at eleven o’clock of that windy
February night, and deeply thankful that his trick
would end in half an hour, stopped suddenly, ears
a-strain, fancying that he had heard, above the
shrieking of the wind, the shrieking of a human
voice coming from the string of cars which
stretched down into the lower yards. Then, deciding
that it was only the wind, after all, he started
on his way again, only to be startled by another
scream there was no mistaking—a scream shrill,
agonized, telling of the last extremity of suffering
and terror.</p>

<p class='c013'>Drawing his revolver, he started toward the cars
as fast as his legs would carry him. As he drew
nearer, the screams increased in shrillness and
agony, and it required no little will-power on the
part of the watchman to keep his legs moving in
the right direction. The thought flashed through
his brain that a man was being slowly torn to pieces
by some ferocious wild beast, but just as he turned
the end of the row of cars, he saw a sudden burst
of flame from one of them, and a blazing figure
pitched out headlong to the ground—a figure
which, with a sudden sense of sickness, the watchman
recognized as a human being.</p>

<p class='c013'>Blowing a shrill blast on his whistle, and pulling
off his overcoat as he ran, he hastened forward.
In a moment he was beside the moaning, struggling,
blackened figure, and threw his overcoat over it,
his heart faint within him, smothering the flames
and beating at them with his gloves. Another
watchman, summoned by the whistle, ran up at that
moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Man burned t’ death,” panted the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who is he?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know; but he’s done for, whoever he
is. You ought to heard him screamin’!”</p>

<p class='c013'>They worked together feverishly for a moment
longer, and beat out the last of the flames, but it
was evident that the unfortunate man at their feet
was far past human aid. He was still moaning and
jerking convulsively, but was mercifully unconscious
and would no doubt remain so to the end.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ve got t’ git away from here, an’ that
mighty quick,” said one of the men, with a glance
at the seething inferno beside them. “That car’s
loaded with oil, an’ it’s goin’ to blow up in about
a minute.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How’re we goin’ to carry him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Roll him on my overcoat—we can carry him
that way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t want to touch him,” faltered the other.
“He—he comes off on your fingers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But the first watchman, with an exclamation of
impatience, spread his overcoat beside the blackened
body and rolled it over with his foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, take a hold of that end,” he said, “an’
git a move on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They gathered up the burden gingerly, and started
away at a trot—not a moment too soon, for they
had gone scarcely a hundred feet, when the car
exploded with a mighty roar. Blazing oil was
hurled over everything in the neighbourhood, and
instantly a dozen cars were afire—the flames roaring
and crackling furiously before the wind.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Stanley, awakened by the arrival of a crew from
an incoming train and the departure of another to
take its place, lay for a while looking down the
room and watching the new arrivals prepare for
bed. He was a restless man and light sleeper at
the best, and he devoutly hoped that the strike was
nearing an end. The strain was beginning to tell
on his nerves, never any too steady, and he longed
for his comfortable and quiet bed. The air in the
freight-house had become fetid from the exhalations
of fifty men, not over dainty in their personal
habits, and with a sudden sense of disgust, Stanley
threw back the covers and sat up in bed.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he did so, it seemed to him that he heard a
faint knocking at the wall underneath him. He
listened a moment, but it was not repeated, and
he decided it was merely the vibration from a passing
engine. But he was burdened with a queer
feeling of suffocation, and slipping into his clothes,
he went out to the platform for a breath of fresh
air.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was worried. He knew, somehow, that, during
his absence in pursuit and prosecution of the
robbers, he had lost his grip of the situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>It had got, in some subtle way, beyond his control,
and he felt the necessity of being “on the
job” at every hour of the day and night. It was
as though he were shadowed by some impending
calamity, which he could not avoid.</p>

<p class='c013'>He heard steps approaching along the platform
and in a moment the freight-house watchman
emerged from the darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything quiet?” Stanley asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything but the wind,” answered the watchman,
laughing at his own joke, and passed on his
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blamed fool!” Stanley muttered to himself,
for the jest and the laugh jarred on him. “I’m
gettin’ as nervous as a cat,” he added, and walked
slowly down the platform, trying to shake off the
feeling of depression.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another thing disturbed him. The tough-looking
strangers whom he had observed loitering about
the depot-saloons for several days past, had suddenly
disappeared. He had made discreet inquiries,
but no one seemed to know who they were or what
had become of them. Where had they gone, he
asked himself; where were they at this moment?
He had heard some vague rumours of the row at
the brotherhood meeting, and he could imagine
Bassett’s rage and chagrin. He had always connected
the strangers with Bassett, in some indefinite
way, and a little shiver shook him at the thought
that perhaps Bassett had taken them with him to
execute some fiendish project. Perhaps—</p>

<p class='c013'>The piercing note of a watchman’s whistle
shrilled through the night, and Stanley, waking
from this reverie with a start, saw a sudden burst
of flame from the cars just before him, and realized
that the crisis he had vaguely expected was at
hand. And the realization made his nerves taut
and his head clear. Not even his worst enemies
had ever accused Stanley of cowardice in the face
of danger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Call the fire department and the police and get
out all our men!” he shouted to the freight-house
watchman, who had just come into view again, and
started with a jump toward the fire, which was
growing brighter every instant.</p>

<p class='c013'>But suddenly he checked himself and swerved in
his course, for from beneath the platform almost
at his feet, he saw a dim form emerge and slink
away through the darkness.</p>

<div id='p318'  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/p318.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>“HE HEARD THE BULLETS SING PAST HIS HEAD.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Stanley was off the platform and after him in
an instant.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Halt!” he shouted, drawing his revolver.
“Halt, or I fire!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And, as if in answer, phitt! phitt! came two
flashes of flame out of the darkness ahead, and he
heard the bullets sing past his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take it, then!” he said, between his teeth, and
fired at the legs of the figure ahead.</p>

<p class='c013'>The figure ran on, and Stanley raised his hand
to fire again; but in a moment he saw that this
would not be necessary, for the fugitive was no
match for him in speed and he gained upon him
rapidly. Apparently, the stranger perceived the
folly of flight, at last, for he stopped, one hand
against his side, and waited for his pursuer to overtake
him. He had not long to wait, for in an instant
Stanley’s heavy hand fell upon his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Drop that revolver!” said the detective, and
knocked it with a quick blow from his prisoner’s
hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, it’s jammed,” said the other, with a little
bitter laugh. “If it hadn’t been fer that, I’d ’a’
got you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s your game?” Stanley demanded, and
swung his prisoner around so that he could see his
face. “Why,” he cried, chuckling with satisfaction,
“if it ain’t our old friend Hummel! This certainly
is a pleasant meeting. Welcome to our
city!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Hummel’s face was livid and his blackened and
swollen lips were drawn away from his teeth in an
ugly snarl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t be too gay!” he said, thickly. “Don’t
be too gay! Mebbe you’ll be laughin’ on the other
side of your face afore long!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, one couldn’t tell which side you’re
laughin’ on,” retorted Stanley, “fer the dirt. Been
livin’ with your friends the hogs?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never you mind!” said Hummel, still more
thickly, and reeled a little and put his hands to his
head. “Never you mind!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, I believe the man’s drunk!” said Stanley.
“Come on back with me, my friend, an’ I’ll send
you up-town in style, behind two horses, with a
gong ringin’ in front. Come on,” and he started
to lead his prisoner back toward the freight-house.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Hummel developed a sudden limpness and
sat down suddenly upon the pavement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What d’you want me fer?” he demanded, sullenly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stanley waved his hand toward the growing conflagration,
which, at that instant, burst, with a
mighty report, into a fountain of flame.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For that,” he said, sternly. “Come along, or
I’ll find a way to make you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I didn’t do that,” protested Hummel, staring
toward the fire, as though conscious of it for the
first time. “That must ’a’ been—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who?” asked Stanley, as Hummel suddenly
checked himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No matter,” answered that worthy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stanley, his patience exhausted, jerked the little
man to his feet and struck him over the head with
his revolver.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come on,” he said savagely, “I ain’t got no
time to waste on you! Step lively, or I’ll put you
to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Away in the distance, he could hear the growing
rattle of the engine gongs and knew, with a breath
of relief, that the fire department was at hand. He
knew something else, too—that within a very few
minutes, a great mob would be upon the scene,
which it would take the hardest kind of work to
control. The windows in the neighbourhood had
been thrown up at sound of the explosion—he
could hear the hum of voices, the cries of alarm.
He had no time to fool with a reluctant prisoner,
and he jerked him again to his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will you come?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” answered Hummel, his face yellow with
terror, struggling desperately to free himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Stanley lost his temper and raised his arm
to strike.</p>

<p class='c013'>But even as he did so, a mighty roar seemed to
rend the firmament above him, the earth rocked, and
a blinding flame leapt upwards towards the heavens.
There was an instant’s appalling silence, and then
came the sound of crashing walls, the rending of
timbers—and again all was still.</p>

<p class='c013'>Only for a breath—then the night was filled
with yells and groans and curses. And the whole
neighbourhood, wakened by the roar, leaped from
bed and rushed out into the streets, white-lipped and
trembling.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Allan West, having slept the greater part of the
day and evening, found himself restless and wakeful
as the night progressed, and at last lay staring
up into the darkness above him, meditating with
smiling lips, on the events of the day. That this
great happiness should have come to him seemed
almost past believing—he had done so little to
deserve it, had escaped so narrowly a nearly fatal
blunder.</p>

<p class='c013'>He cast his mind back over the years he had
spent with the Welshes, remembering how he had
seen Mamie grow from a child of eight, through
all the stages of girlhood, to the radiant young
womanhood she had attained; he had seen her
sweetness of disposition tested scores of times;
he knew how true and honest and loving she was,
and he could not but wonder at his own blindness,
at his tardy awakening to his love for her. Most
wonderful of all it seemed that she should care
for him, that she—</p>

<p class='c013'>The window rattled suddenly and sharply, the
house seemed to quiver, as though struck by some
giant hand, and almost instantly there came a deep,
jarring roar. A moment later, Allan heard the
distant ringing of the fire alarm, heard excited
footsteps along the street, and groped blindly along
the floor for the board to which his instrument was
attached.</p>

<p class='c013'>He found it at last, seized it, pulled it up, and
began calling the dispatchers’ office. Fully a minute
passed before the answer came, and he knew
that the dispatcher had not been at his key.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is West,” he clicked. “Any trouble up
there?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Trouble!” flashed back the answer, in a staccato
which told how excited the sender was. “I
should say so! All the cars in the yards are afire
and the freight-house is blown up!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan gently replaced the instrument on the floor
and slid out of bed. He groped his way to the
closet, got out his clothes and slipped into them as
quietly as he could. Shirt and coat gave him some
trouble, but he managed to get them on, gritting
his teeth at the pain the movement cost him. Then,
without collar or tie, which he knew were beyond
him, even if he had cared to linger for such trifles,
he took his shoes in his hand, opened his door softly,
and started down the stairs, hoping that he might
get away unseen.</p>

<p class='c013'>But before he was half way down, he heard light
steps behind him and a low voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Allan!” it called.</p>

<p class='c013'>He turned as Mamie came flying down to him,
visible only as a dim shape in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re not going out!” she protested, her
hands upon his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I must,” he said, bending and kissing her.
“The strikers have fired the yards and blown up
the freight-house. I’ve got to go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you’re not able!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes, I am,” he contradicted lightly, but he
was grateful for the darkness which hid his face
from her anxious eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And there’ll probably be more trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All the more reason I should be there. You
wouldn’t have me be a coward, Mamie!”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the one appeal to touch her, and he knew
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” she said, “I wouldn’t have you be a
coward. Go if you must; but, oh, Allan dear, be
careful of yourself for my sake!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will,” he promised and kissed her again, as
she went with him down the stairs. “I’ve got to
put on my shoes,” he added. “I thought maybe I
could get away and be back and in bed again without
anyone knowing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me put them on,” she said quickly. “You
can never manage it. You know, in the old days,
the ladies used to buckle on the armour of their
knights,” and she took the shoes from him, pressed
him into a chair and knelt before him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m sure no knight ever had a fairer lady,”
and he caressed her hair with tender hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>He could feel the head lift proudly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nor any lady a braver knight,” she said.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘I could not love thee, dear, so much,</div>
      <div class='line in7'>Loved I not honour more!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Allan hummed. “But what an imagination you’ve
got, Mamie!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—you know I’m Irish.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what a warm, loyal heart!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s Irish, too, isn’t it? And there the armour’s
on!” she added, rising. “And now your
overcoat, for it’s bitter cold, and this muffler around
your neck,” and she tucked the ends in under his
coat. “There,” she concluded, buttoning the last
button, and raised herself on tip-toe and kissed him.
“Good-bye, Allan, and come back to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-bye, Mamie; never fear,” and he was off
and away.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Mamie, drawing closer about her the shawl
she had thrown on when she slipped out of bed,
hurried up the stairs and knocked at the door of
the room where her parents slept. It was in the
back wing of the house, farthest from the street,
which accounted for the fact that they had not been
awakened by the hurrying feet and excited talk of
the ever-increasing crowd running toward the fire.
But Mamie’s knock awakened Mary on the instant.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it?” she called.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s Mamie—the strikers have set the yards
on fire and blown up the freight-house—and Allan’s
gone!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gone!” echoed Mary, and sprang out of bed.
“Jack!” she cried. “Wake up!” and she repeated
to him what Mamie had just told her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, with never a word, was out of bed and into
his clothes, while his wife, with trembling fingers,
lighted a lamp and opened the door for Mamie.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you know he’s gone?” demanded
Mary. “Did you see him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said the girl, her white face and trembling
lips telling of her struggle for self-control.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you let him go?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He had to go—it was his place to go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’s right, mother,” broke in Jack. “He had
to go. I’m proud of the boy. An’ I’ll see no harm
comes to him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you, dad,” said Mamie, simply, and
kissed him. “You’ll telephone as soon as the danger’s
over?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Jack promised; “an’ don’t be worried.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They heard the front door slam after him, and
the house was still.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m going to get dressed,” said Mamie; “then—then
if anything happens, we’ll be ready.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She stole away to her room, but she did not proceed
immediately to dress. Instead, she slipped
down beside her bed and threw her arms forward
across it and buried her face in them—and when,
five minutes later, she arose, it was with a countenance
pale, indeed, but serene and almost smiling.</p>

<p class='c013'>She found her mother awaiting her in the dining-room,
and they sat down together and—waited.
There is no harder task, and as the weary minutes
dragged along, they dared not look at each other,
lest their self-control slip from them. So half an
hour passed, until Mrs. Welsh could stand it no
longer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m going to git some news,” she said, and went
to the telephone, but central could tell her little more
than she already knew, for everything was confusion
as yet at the scene of the outrage. The dispatchers’
office was busy and refused to answer any
call. So Mary hung up the receiver again and came
back to Mamie. “I’ll try again after a while,” she
said, and again they nerved themselves to wait.</p>

<p class='c013'>But not for long.</p>

<p class='c013'>For suddenly, the telephone rang sharply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll go,” said Mary, and Mamie sat where she
was, clutching blindly at her chair, biting her lips
until the blood came.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s not hurt!” she said, over and over to
herself. “He’s not hurt! He’s not hurt! It can’t
be! It sha’n’t be! He’s not hurt!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is that you, Mary?” asked Jack’s voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; what’s the matter?—your voice don’t
sound natural.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The boy’s hurted,” said Jack, his voice breaking
in a sob. “Bring Mamie an’ come quick.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where to?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To Chestnut’s drugstore. I can’t tell you,
Mary, but fer God’s sake, come quick!”</p>

  <h2 id='ch28' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVIII <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>HUMMEL KEEPS HIS WORD</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>A<span class='sc'>llan</span>, as he turned into the street before the
house, was caught by a fierce gust of wind, whirled
against a tree at the edge of the pavement, and
would have fallen, had not a strong arm grasped
him about the waist.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure, an’ ’tis a reg’lar hurricane,” shouted a
well-known voice, and Allan found himself gazing
into the cheerful face of Reddy Magraw.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, Reddy,” he cried, “what are you doing
here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was sent after you,” Reddy explained, “an’
it was well I was—ye niver could have got up
there by yerself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense!” Allan protested. “I’m nearly as
strong as I ever was. That gust caught me unprepared,
that’s all. Come on.” He didn’t ask who
it was had sent Reddy, but supposed of course it
was Stanley.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll jest hold on to yer arm, anyways,” said
Reddy. “Is this the well one?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; hold on to it, if you want to; maybe
it’ll keep you from being blown away;” but to
himself Allan was forced to confess more than
once that Reddy’s arm was a welcome support.
For he was weaker than he had thought—weaker
than he was willing to acknowledge, even to himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>As for Reddy, he judged it best to say nothing
as to how he had come to be appointed Allan’s
body-guard. He had been routed out of bed by
Mrs. Magraw at the first explosion. Across the
yards from their front window they could see the
flames spreading, and Reddy jumped into his clothes
in a hurry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now listen to me,” his wife had said, as this
process was in progress, “there’s jist one thing fer
ye t’ do this night, Reddy Magraw, an’ that is t’
kape yerself glued t’ Allan West an’ t’ see the boy
don’t come t’ no harm. They’ll be gittin’ him out
o’ bed the first thing, an’ him scarce able t’ stand!
Reddy Magraw, if any harm comes t’ him this
night, I’ll niver fegive ye!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t ye fear, darlint,” Reddy assured her.
“I’ll stick t’ him like beeswax,” and, giving her a
quick hug, he ran from the house and down the
path to the gate.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Magraw opened her lips to call to him;
but closed them again by a mighty effort, and stood
watching his dim figure until it vanished in the
darkness. Then, drawing a chair close to the front
window, she sat down and watched the flames grow
and spread. Her face was very pale, and her lips
moved mechanically as she told over and over again
the beads of her rosary.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>“There’s the very divil t’ pay,” Reddy went on,
as he and Allan hurried forward. “I didn’t stop
t’ see much of it, but I saw enough.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As a matter of fact, he hadn’t stopped at all, but
had made a bee-line for Allan’s gate, fearing that
he would miss him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You kin see the fire now,” he added, a moment
later, and Allan, looking up, saw ahead of him a
red glow against the sky, which spread and brightened,
even as he watched it.</p>

<p class='c013'>All about them were people hastening in the same
direction, and as they neared the yards, they could
hear the excited shouts of the crowd already assembled,
the clanging of the fire-engines, and finally,
just as they arrived, the swish and hiss of water
as it was turned on the flames.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Allan paused for only a glance at the fire,
serious as it appeared to be. Mere property loss,
however heavy, was a little thing in comparison
with the possible loss of life which the wrecking
of the freight-house involved, and he pushed his
way forward through the crowd, anxious to learn
the worst at once. The town’s limited police force
was already on the scene, but the crowd was entirely
beyond its control, and the most it could accomplish
was to keep clear a space on the freight platform
where two physicians were already busily at work,
by the light of an engine headlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Toward these, Allan made his way with a curious
sinking of the heart. The policemen recognized
him and passed him through, and at that
moment, one of the doctors rose with a little gesture
of despair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We can’t do anything for him,” he said. “The
poor devil’s about out of his misery.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan, staring down at the blackened shape upon
the platform, scarcely recognized in it a human
being.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who is it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know him,” said the doctor, looking
up and recognizing the chief dispatcher. “Maybe
you do,” and he knelt down again and turned the
distorted and blackened countenance so that the
light shone full upon it.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the first sickened glance, Allan decided that
he had never seen the man, then a certain familiarity
struck through to his consciousness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, it’s Rafe Bassett!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rafe Bassett!” echoed a voice, and Allan
turned to find that Stanley had broken a way
through the crowd. “Well, that’s justice for
you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Justice?” echoed Allan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was him did all that,” said Stanley, with a
wave of the hand toward the burning cars. “Set
fire to them an’ got burned up hisself!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The crowd pressing upon the policemen heard
the words and a low angry murmur ran through it,
for with that blackened shape before them, the detective’s
words sounded particularly heartless.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Men,” cried Stanley, facing them, “this ain’t
no guesswork. Rafe Bassett was kicked out of the
brotherhood t’-night, an’ decided t’ git even this
way. He set that car of oil on fire—<i>but he was
inside the car</i>—an’ before he could git the door
open, this is what happened to him. I pity the poor
devil as much as any of you—an’ yet I say ’twas
justice.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s right,” nodded a man at the front of the
crowd. “He’s right. Let’s have no trouble here,
men.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan looked down again at the dim and shapeless
mass.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is there an ambulance?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” answered one of the doctors. “Two
of them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take him away, then; and see that he is cared
for. After all, he’s dead, Stanley.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ a blamed good thing, too,” muttered Stanley,
whose stock of sentiment was very small;
but he took care that the crowd did not hear the
words. After all, there was no use in provoking
trouble.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And how about the others?” asked Allan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What others?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The men in the freight-house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh,” answered Stanley, with a grin, “they was
more scared than hurt.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan drew a quick breath of relief.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But didn’t the bomb wreck the place?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, it wrecked it all right; at least this end
of it; but by good luck, it blew the end wall out,
instead of in, and the roof didn’t fall until everybody
had scrambled out. I thought there’d been
at least a dozen killed by the way they hollered
after the bomb went off, but nobody was hurt beyond
some cuts and bruises.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, that was good luck!” said Allan. “That
takes the biggest kind of a load off my heart.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; and the best luck of all,” added Stanley
dryly, “is that I caught the man who did it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The man who did it?” Allan stopped short
in amazement to look at his companion. “Do you
mean it, Stanley?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mean it? I should say I did. It was the
merest luck—I fell right on to him as he was
gettin’ away, and when I started to take him back
to the freight-house he was scared to death—but
he don’t deny it, fer that matter.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who was it?” asked Allan. “One of the
strikers?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said Stanley, grinning again. “One of
the strike-breakers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again Allan stopped to gaze in amazement at
his companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hummel,” explained Stanley, his face fairly
glowing with satisfaction. “Oh, this has been a
great night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is he now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got him under guard in the freight office—I’ll
send him up to the county jail pretty soon—but
he said he wanted to see you first.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To see me? What for?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know. Maybe he wants to confess
and tell who his pals were. Of course we know
Bassett was. I’ve got a sort of idea that Bassett
was at the head of the whole thing. There’s the
freight-house. You kin see what damage the bomb
did.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was certainly a frightful looking place. The
end wall of the building had been blown out bodily,
and a great section of the platform had also been
blown away. Evidently Hummel had placed the
bomb just inside the wall. There was, at either end
of the building, a small square ventilator near the
ground, covered with a piece of perforated iron,
as such openings usually are. Later investigation
showed that Hummel had probably knocked out this
plate, and as the ventilator was too small to permit
the passage of his body, he had placed the bomb
as far inside as he could reach, and had then attached
and lighted the fuse. The position of the
bomb, by a fortunate chance, was such that the
greatest force of the explosion was directed outwards,
and while the end wall had fallen, it had
fallen outward and not inward, and the side walls
had remained nearly intact. The roof had sagged
badly, but had not fallen. The other end of the
freight-house, at which were the offices, had not
been injured at all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan stood for a moment contemplating this
wreckage, and as he turned away, he felt a touch on
his arm. He turned to find himself face to face
with Simpson, the special delegate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. West,” said Simpson, “I hope I may have
a few words with you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, certainly,” said Allan. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the first place, I want to assure you that no
brotherhood man had anything to do with this,”
and he waved his hand toward the wrecked freight-house
and the blazing cars.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We know who did both,” said Allan quietly.
“The man who set fire to the cars was a union
man.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who was it?” asked Simpson quickly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rafe Bassett.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simpson’s face grew a shade paler, and his eyes
lighted with a grim satisfaction, as he realized how
this discovery vindicated the course he had taken
with regard to the strike.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bassett was not a union man; he was suspended
from the lodge last night,” he said, quietly.
“He would never have been reinstated. I suspect
him of having had something to do with that outrage
at Cincinnati, and I believe all this was done
simply to revenge himself on the brotherhood and
give it a black eye.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you were going to carry on the strike for
a man like that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, Mr. West, we were not,” answered Simpson
earnestly. “After Bassett was run out of the
hall last night, a committee was appointed to wait
upon you in the morning and declare the strike
off.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan’s face brightened wonderfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Without condition?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“With only one condition—that the men be reinstated
in their old positions—all except Bassett.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We have promised to give permanent positions
to any of the new men who made good,” said
Allan. “We must keep that promise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We have no objection to that. Mighty few of
them can hold a permanent job. Mr. West, I’m
going to be candid with you. This strike was begun
foolishly and without proper investigation. You
know why—it was because of your exposure of
Nixon. Now we are anxious to make such amends
as we can, and we go further than we usually do.
We agree, as I have said, to your giving permanent
places to as many of the strike-breakers as you care
to keep and as care to stay.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan held out his hand quickly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I understand the strike is ended?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will end at noon, if you say so.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do say so.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good!” cried Simpson, and grasped the hand
held out to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not more than half a dozen men were within
hearing, but the news of the great event passed like
lightning from mouth to mouth, and the crowd was
soon cheering like mad.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Stanley, “I guess my job’s done.
I’ll be mighty glad t’ git back t’ my bed ag’in. Will
you see Hummel before I send him up-town?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; only I’ve got two or three things to do
first. Let’s have a look at the fire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They started together toward the lower yards,
and Stanley, after glancing back once or twice,
leaned over and spoke in a carefully repressed undertone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a tough-lookin’ feller been follerin’ you
around all night,” he said. “He’s right behind us
now. Glance around kind of careless-like an’ see if
you know him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan glanced apprehensively over his shoulder,
and then laughed outright as he recognized his
faithful body-guard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, that’s Reddy Magraw,” he said. “He
thinks I’m going to keel over any minute, and he’s
ready to catch me when I do.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh,” said Stanley, in a chagrined tone; “I
didn’t recognize him in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Didn’t you send him after me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Send him? Why, no. Did he say I did?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I don’t know that he said exactly that.
But if you didn’t, who did? I wonder—”</p>

<p class='c013'>But they had reached the place where the cars
were blazing, and the matter was driven from Allan’s
mind for the time being. It was soon evident
that all danger of the fire spreading further was
over. The cars in the neighbourhood had been
jerked away to a place of safety, and three or four
lines of hose were playing upon the fire, with the
result that it was soon under control. Six cars and
their contents had been destroyed and twice as many
more damaged to some extent, but this loss seemed
trifling to Allan beside what might have been.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now I’ve got a report to make, and then I’m
done,” he said to Stanley. “I’ll come over to the
freight office just as soon as I can.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, sir,” said Stanley, and hurried away
to provide fresh quarters for the strike-breakers.
He found them fraternizing with the brotherhood
men, and Simpson himself proposed a solution of
the problem of lodging them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why not bring them up to the lodge room?”
he said. “It’s plenty big enough, and each man can
bring his cot with him. We’ll see that breakfast
is ready for them in the morning and after that,
I guess they can get board around town somewhere.
I hope you’ll approve,” he added to Stanley. “We
want to show we’re in earnest about this thing and
that we bear no grudge against anyone.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” agreed Stanley; “I don’t see no objections;
though of course, I see your little game,”
he added, in an undertone. “These fellers’ll be
union men inside of a week.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simpson made no reply, but smiled a diplomatic
smile; and Stanley’s prediction came true; for all
of the strangers who secured permanent positions,
joined the brotherhood in a very short time. It
may be added, in passing, however, that not above
eight or ten remained at Wadsworth. Most of
them had the wanderlust in their blood; they could
be contented in one place only for a very short time,
and then must be moving on; while the rest were
victims of an even worse disease, which converted
them from men into brutes, and rendered them unfit
to hold any position.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Allan, hurrying across the yards in the direction
of his office, was conscious of quick steps behind
him, and turned to find that Jack Welsh had joined
Reddy Magraw.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So here you are!” cried Jack. “Well, I certainly
am glad to see you. And you’re not hurted?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hurt?” repeated Allan. “Why, no, of course
not; why should I be?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you’re about ready to go home? The
women are jest naterally worrited to death about
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I’m all right,” Allan assured him, though
he was conscious that both head and shoulder were
aching numbly. “Reddy’s been dogging me like
a shadow. I’ll be ready to go back before long.
You’ve heard the news?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No. What?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The strike’s off. I’m just going to wire the
news to Mr. Schofield. Then I’ll be ready to go
home. I must be up early in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll wait fer you,” said Jack, and he and
Reddy sat down on the bottom step of the steep
flight which led to the dispatchers’ office, while
Allan hurried up the stairs.</p>

<p class='c013'>It took but a moment to get Mr. Schofield on the
line. He had been sent the first news of the disaster,
and was anxious to know how serious it was.
Allan’s first words reassured him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nobody hurt,” Allan flashed, “and not over
six cars destroyed, though some damage to others.
Fire about out. Freight-house badly wrecked.
Bassett set fire to cars and was burned to death.
We also have fellow who set off bomb. Just saw
Simpson, and arranged to have strike called off at
noon to-day. No conditions. Admits that strike
was mistake and says Bassett was fired from
brotherhood last night. Willing to do most anything
to square himself. And I guess that’s all
till I see you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was an instant’s pause before Mr. Schofield
answered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“West,” he began, “this is the greatest night’s
work you ever did. Are you able to be up?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m aching some,” Allan answered, “but I’m
going home to bed now. Everything is well in
hand. I guess there’s no further danger of trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wait a minute,” came the answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan waited until his instrument began again to
call him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right,” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is Round,” chattered the instrument.
“Schofield has just been telling me. I want to congratulate
you—and order you to take at least a
month’s vacation.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess I’ll wait till my honeymoon,” answered
Allan, and laughed to himself at the thought.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you engaged?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes. Tell Mr. Schofield I’ve taken his advice.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When is it to be?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t know yet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, mind you ask me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And here’s my best wishes, my boy. Now go
home and go to bed. I’ll be at Wadsworth in a day
or two, and will tell you then what I think about
your work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right; thank you. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan closed his key with a click, and as he did
so, he was conscious of a throng around his desk.
He looked up to see all the employees on duty and
some who weren’t on duty, but who had been got
out of bed by the disturbance, crowding around
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shake!” they said. “Of course we heard
that,” and Allan gripped one hand after another,
his eyes shining.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you, boys,” was all he could say.
“Thank you.”</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>He rejoined Jack and Reddy, at last, at the foot
of the stairs.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just one more errand and then I’m ready to
go home,” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems to me they allers is one more,” rejoined
Jack. “What is it now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The fellow who blew up the freight-house wants
to see me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The fellow who blew up the freight-house?
Have you got him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; Stanley nabbed him and has got him over
there in the freight office. I guess he’s kept it quiet
for fear the fellow’d be mobbed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ that’s more sense than Stanley usually
shows,” said Reddy. “Who is the varmint?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“His name’s Hummel—you’ll remember him,
Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did I iver see him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s the fellow who ran after me across the
yards that night—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ tried t’ knife ye,” added Jack, his face
flushing darkly. “Bad cess to him. What’s he
want with ye now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stanley thinks maybe he wants to confess.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“More likely he wants to take a shot at you.
Don’t you go, Allan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, nonsense, Jack,” laughed Allan. “He’s
under arrest. He can’t harm me, even if he wants
to. There he is now,” he added, as a little procession
emerged from the freight office.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stanley had seen Allan coming across the tracks,
and anxious to have the interview over and get
his prisoner away before any hint of his identity
should get about, had brought him out, surrounded
by three or four officers. The crowd had melted
away considerably, and what there was left of it
was either watching the last embers of the fire, or
inspecting the ruined freight-house. So the little
group came out into the yards unnoticed, and
stopped in the shadow of the building until Allan
and his two friends came up.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan, stopping close to Hummel, saw that he
was handcuffed, and therefore incapable of doing
any one harm. He seemed bent and shrunken and
only half-conscious, as though on the verge of collapse.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, Hummel,” he said, “you wanted to see
me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Hummel lifted his eyes and stared at him coldly,
for an instant, as though not recognizing him; then
his eyes brightened with rage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” he said, thickly, “I wanted t’ see you.
I hope you’re satisfied with this night’s work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, yes,” said Allan with a smile. “Don’t
you think I have reason to be? Have you anything
to tell me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Hummel, his face growing more
livid still, as he glared at the other. “It’s this—I’ll
be in hell to-night an’ so will you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And he suddenly raised his handcuffed hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan was dimly conscious of a heavy form hurling
itself past him, of a close grapple, of an instant’s
pause broken only by oaths and hoarse shouting;
he seemed to see Reddy Magraw grappling
with the anarchist; then the world was blotted out
in a white flash of flame.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>M<span class='sc'>ary</span> W<span class='sc'>elsh</span> and Mamie, hurrying with anxious
hearts and pallid cheeks, not daring to think of what
awaited them, toward Chestnut’s drugstore, in answer
to Jack’s summons, were met outside the little
triangular frame building from which the drugstore
stared out upon the tracks, by Jack himself, his face
gray and lined with suffering and self-accusation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wait a minute,” he said, hoarsely, and Mary,
reading the suffering in his eyes, put her hand
quickly upon his arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How is he?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know yet. The doctor’s just finishin’
with him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And then his self-control gave way, and a great
sob shook him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A nice guardeen I am, ain’t I?” he asked, bitterly.
“Oh, I could go an’ throw myself under the
wheels of that engine there!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t, Jack!” protested Mary, quickly.
“Don’t take it so. Whatever happened wasn’t your
fault.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, it was! I stood by like a dumb beast an’
let Hummel—Kin ye ever forgive me, Mamie?
Oh, but I’m shamed t’ look ye in the eyes!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Forgive you, dad?” cried the girl, her heart
smitten as she looked at him. “Why, dad, there’s
nothing to forgive. I know you did your best.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not like Reddy Magraw,” said Jack, the tears
streaming down his face. “Not like Reddy Magraw.
Do you know what he did—he saw that
varmint fumblin’ at his pocket, an’ he must have
guessed what was comin’—I was lookin’, too, but
I never thought of nothin’ like that—an’ Reddy
jumped fer him an’ grabbed him—an’ jest then
the bomb went off—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s dead, ain’t he, Jack?” asked Mary.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Jack, with a hoarse sob, “an’ so’s
Reddy Magraw—an’ if our boy lives, it’ll be because
of Reddy, not because o’ me. That’s what it
makes me sick t’ think of!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Reddy dead!” gasped Mary, the tears starting
to her eyes. “Does—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said Jack. “You’ll have t’ tell her. I
couldn’t to save my soul.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll tell her,” said Mary, quietly. “She’ll be
proud when she knows.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And then the door opened and they saw the doctor
standing on the threshold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come in,” he said softly. “You can see him
now; and it’s all right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You mean he ain’t dead?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, nor going to die. Is this Mamie?” he
added, turning to the young woman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s been asking for you. He mustn’t be excited,”
he added, looking at the others. “Is it necessary
that you see him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mary gulped back the indignant words which rose
to her lips. Necessary that she see her boy!</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” she said, steadily. “We’ll jest excite
him. You go, Mamie. Jack’ll wait fer ye,” and
she held Jack by the hand until Mamie had entered
and the door had closed behind her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s her place, not mine,” she said. “An’ now
I’ll go over t’ the Magraws.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mary,” said Jack, hoarsely, and put his arm
around her, “you’re the bravest little woman I iver
knew. I’m proud of ye.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Mary felt anything but brave as, in the gray
light of the dawn, she slowly crossed the tracks and
mounted the path to the door of the little house.
For, after all, what could she say to lighten the
force of the blow? What could anyone say? Suppose
it was some one else coming to tell her of
Jack? She caught her breath sharply—</p>

<p class='c013'>And then she was conscious that the door was
open and when she looked up, she saw Mrs. Magraw
standing there and gazing down at her, a strange
light in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come in,” she said, and led the way into the
little parlour, from which, during the night, she
had watched the flames across the yards. “I
knowed ye’d come,” she added. “I knowed ye’d
want t’ be the one t’ tell me—an’ I thank ye,
Mary Welsh.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You—you know?” gasped Mary, staring at
her. “Somebody’s told you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, nobody’s told me; but I know. I knowed
when I saw him goin’ away that he was niver comin’
back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An’ you let him go?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I sent him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sent him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“T’ guard the boy? Did he guard him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>And Mary Welsh flung herself upon her knees
before the other woman and buried her face in her
lap.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He did!” she said, thickly. “With his life.”</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Mr. Schofield, relieved of the stress of duty at
Cincinnati, arrived at Wadsworth on the early
train next day, and at once took charge of the
situation. There was much to do. The whole train-service
of the road had to be reorganized, the ravelled
ends gathered up again, the freight-house rebuilt,
traffic provided for; and for four days and
nights he thought of nothing else. Then, the first
strain past, he put on his hat one afternoon, and
started back over the yards to a little house which
stood high on an embankment facing them.</p>

<p class='c013'>He climbed the steep path, and paused for a
moment to look down over the yards before knocking
at the door. His eyes gleamed with pride as he
watched the busy engines, the assembled cars, the
evidences of orderly and busy life.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he turned and knocked. An Irish woman
well past middle-age, and with hair snowy white,
opened the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs. Magraw?” asked the visitor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yis, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My name’s Schofield.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know ye, sir,” said Mrs. Magraw, quietly.
“This ain’t the first toime ye’ve been to see me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No—but that was a good many years ago.
If you don’t mind, I’ll sit down here on the porch.
I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, sir,” said Mrs. Magraw, and tried to
dust off the bench, but Mr. Schofield was too quick
for her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve heard how your husband died,” he began
gently, “and I want to say this: no man ever died
a nobler death.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m proud of him, sir,” said Mrs. Magraw, her
eyes filling with tears. “I’m prouder of him than
I kin say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re all proud of him. I’ve been proud of
him for many years. It isn’t the first time he’s
proved the stuff he was made of.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Magraw nodded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But there’s no use for me to tell you that,”
went on the superintendent. “You knew him better
than I did. Now here’s what I’ve come to say.
The road has pensioned you for life. You will receive
a check every month for thirty dollars.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thirty dollars!” echoed Mrs. Magraw.
“Why, sir,—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it isn’t very much—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very much! It’s all the difference between
starvin’ an’ livin’, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m glad of that. How old is your oldest boy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thirteen, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you want him to be?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, sir, he seems to have a taste fer mechanics.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right; there’s a job waiting for him, and
for all the other boys when they’re old enough.
The road wants to make life just as easy for you
as it can, Mrs. Magraw; and even at that, it feels
that it has done mighty little—so little that I was
almost ashamed to come here to-day and tell you.
It’s not in any sense intended as a recompense—don’t
think it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I understand, sir,” said Mrs. Magraw, and
there was in her face a sweet dignity. “An’ I’ve
had my recompense—with the flowers an’ the men
at the funeral—the shop-men, sir, an’ the brotherhood—stretchin’
clear out t’ the street yonder, an’
cryin’, sir, as if ’twas their own brother—”</p>

<p class='c013'>She stopped, her eyes gleaming.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He was the brother of every one of us,” he
said; and added, soberly, “I wish I was as good
a man!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Magraw watched him as he crossed the
yards; watched him till a corner of the round-house
hid him from view; then she turned slowly
back into the house, her face shining.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Reddy,” she said hoarsely to herself; “it’s
a proud woman I am this day; proud fer ye—proud
fer ye—oh, an’ heart-broken, too.”</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>The next afternoon, Mr. Schofield called up Jack
Welsh’s residence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How’s Allan getting along?” he asked of the
woman’s voice which answered the phone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s gittin’ along as well as could be expected.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is he able to sit up?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir; he sets up a little every day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is Schofield talking. I wonder if I could
see him this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir; I guess so,” answered the voice, but
without enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, tell him I’ll be down in about an hour—and
if he can’t see me yet awhile, let me know.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s Mister Schofield wantin’ to see you,” Mary
announced to Allan, three minutes later. “Says
he’ll be here in an hour. Hadn’t I better tell him
you ain’t able?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I guess I’m able,” said Allan, smiling up
at her.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was lying back in a great chair, with Mamie
beside him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s time he was askin’ after ye.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s been pretty busy, I suspect.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mary snorted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A good excuse! An’ I know what he’s comin’
fer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?” asked Allan, smiling broadly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’ll be wantin’ to know when you’re comin’
back to work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I’ll tell him Monday.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Monday, indeed,” cried Mary and Mamie both.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, I’m all right again,” Allan protested.
“A little shaky and scary, but I’ll get over that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we’ll see about it,” said Mamie, in a
tone which told that she was far from being convinced.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Welsh went about her household work,
leaving the two together, and presently there came
the expected knock at the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>But when she opened it, it was not Mr. Schofield
alone who stood there. With him was a man
with blue eyes and light hair and flowing blonde
moustache whom Mrs. Welsh had never seen before.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you do, Mrs. Welsh,” said Mr. Schofield,
shaking hands with her. “This is Mr.
Round,” he added, and Mr. Round also shook
hands. “Can we see the invalid?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ye-yes, sir,” stammered Mary, more overwhelmed
than she had ever been in her life. “Right
up these stairs, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She led the way and ushered them into Allan’s
room.</p>

<p class='c013'>He started and flushed when he saw who Mr.
Schofield’s companion was.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said Mr. Schofield, smiling at Mrs. Welsh,
“I didn’t come this time to ask you when you’re
coming back to work; but to say good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-bye?” echoed Allan. “You’re not going
away?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s got too big for us,” said Mr. Round.
“I’ve been afraid of it for a long time. Let me
introduce you to the new general superintendent
of the Rock Island.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What!” cried Allan, his face beaming. “Oh,
but I’m glad!” and he held out his hand eagerly.
“Sorry, too,” he added. “You’ve been one of the
best friends I ever had.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And always will be,” said Mr. Schofield heartily.
“We’re all proud of you, Allan. Let me see,
how old are you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Twenty-seven.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rather young for train master,” said Mr.
Round, looking at him quizzically.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Train master?” Allan echoed, suddenly white.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Though we’ll try you, anyway,” and Mr.
Round smiled broadly. “That is, if you accept.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why,” stammered Allan, “I can’t—I
don’t—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t try. There’s no hurry, either. You
know what I said to you about a vacation?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Allan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you said something about a honeymoon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mamie flushed crimson, and even Allan reddened
a little.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is this the young lady?” asked Mr. Round,
looking at Mamie approvingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Allan. “Mamie—Miss Welsh.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I congratulate you, my dear,” said Mr. Round,
shaking her kindly by the hand. “I’ve heard of
that exploit of yours. The road is your debtor
more than I can say. I hate to think what would
have happened if it hadn’t been for you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I take the credit of this match,” added Mr.
Schofield, laughing. “I told Allan it was the only
proper thing to do.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d already arrived at the same conclusion,”
said Allan, “and we’d just settled it when you
called up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said Mr. Round, with another glance at
Mamie’s rosy face, “I think you’re to be congratulated
too, Allan. You seem to have a knack of
falling on your feet. When is it to take place?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Next month,” answered Allan, boldly, without
even glancing at Mamie.</p>

<p class='c013'>That young lady opened her lips and stared at
him in astonishment, but closed them again without
speaking.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where are you going for the honeymoon?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, we haven’t decided. We haven’t much
money to spend on a honeymoon, you know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you thought of California?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of California? No, nor of the moon,” answered
Allan, with a laugh. “Palm Beach, maybe,
if we can get transportation.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I guess you can,” said Mr. Round, with
a little laugh. “But I’m sorry you hadn’t thought
of California. You see, when you spoke of the
honeymoon, I thought a little trip through the west
would be just the thing, so I pulled a few wires,
and here,” he put his hand in his pocket and brought
out a thick envelope, “is the result. What shall
I do with it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it?” asked Allan and Mamie in the
same breath.</p>

<p class='c013'>“An order from the President to place my private
car at your disposal for a month—transportation
over the Southern Pacific going and the Northern
Pacific returning—what do you say, children?”</p>

<p class='c013'>What could they say!</p>

<p class='c013'>With a chuckle of sheer enjoyment, Mr. Round
tossed the envelope into Allan’s lap.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mind you ask me to the wedding,” he said, and
caught up his hat. “Come on, Schofield. We’re
in the way.”</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>“How do you know I’m going to marry you
next month?” demanded Mamie.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know you are—you can’t refuse—it might
send me into a decline.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Decline, indeed,” sniffed Mamie.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I knew you wouldn’t!” laughed Allan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mamie laughed too, and kissed him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you feel like a fairy god-child?” she
asked. “I do.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What day is it?” he asked, suddenly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The fifteenth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then to-morrow’s Betty Heywood’s wedding—and
I can’t be there—I haven’t even sent a gift.
What will she think of me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Write and tell her,” suggested Mamie, and
Allan did—told her more, perhaps, than Mamie
intended he should; and the answer came promptly
two days later.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Dear Allan,” it ran, “Your letter was the dearest
wedding gift of all; to know that you had found
the right girl and that you are happy was just the
one thing needed to give the crowning touch to my
own happiness. So you see that I was right! I’ve
never doubted it for an instant, but just the same
I’m glad it’s proved. I’m scribbling this at the last
moment, for your letter just came; there’s the wedding
march—I must go. I’m very, very happy,
Allan, and I suppose that this is the last time I shall
ever sign myself</p>
<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Betty Heywood</span>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Allan looked up from the letter, his eyes shining.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’s a dear girl,” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” agreed Mamie, a little doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But not the dearest,” added Allan smiling.
“Come here. Look what a beautiful sunset. Look
at those crimson clouds along the horizon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who is the dearest?” asked Mamie, refusing
to be led aside from the question under discussion.
“Can’t you guess?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m not good at guessing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s the same one I jerked from in front of an
engine years and years ago; the same one I used
to do sums for; the same one who saved my life
just the other day. Now can you guess?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Mamie, dimpling and snuggling
close to him; “yes, I think I can!”</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>And so we leave them.</p>

<p class='c013'>What does the future hold? For one thing, be
sure that it holds happiness. Be sure, too, that the
young train master will not always be merely that.
He can afford to wait—to grow and broaden, to
learn his business thoroughly; but the time will
come when he will step up and up. Yet, however
high he climbs, those first years, whose history we
know, will be a sweet and ever-present memory, as
years of trial always are when one has emerged
from them triumphant.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
